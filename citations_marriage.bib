               incidence of domestic violence (DV) using a unique set of
               microdata from the World Bank's Living Standard Measurement
               Survey for Tanzania. We use idiosyncratic variation in rainfall

               large set of potential confounding variables on the individual,
               household and community levels, while exploiting intra-and
               inter-community rainfall variation for identification. We find
               that rainfall shocks substantially increase the likelihood of
               the DV incidence in the household. A one standard deviation
               negative rainfall shock increases the incidence of domestic
               violence by about 18.8 percentage points compared to baseline
               for wives. We furthermore show that rainfall shocks have an
               effect on physical violence, while we do not find an effect on
               severe physical or sexual abuse, which is consistent with the
               strategic use of violence. Estimates from non-linear
               specifications reveal that the overall effects are driven by
               droughts rather than floods. We furthermore show that effects

  abstract  = "We study how aggregate economic conditions affect the timing of
               marriage, and particularly child marriage, in Sub‐Saharan Africa
               and in India. In both regions, substantial monetary or in‐kind
               transfers occur with marriage: bride price across Sub‐Saharan
               Africa and dowry in India. In a simple equilibrium model of the
               marriage market in which parents choose when their children
               marry, income shocks affect the age of marriage because marriage
               payments are a source of consumption smoothing, particularly for
               a woman's family. As predicted by our model, we show that
               droughts, which reduce annual crop yields by 10 to 15\% and
               aggregate income by 4 to 5\%, have opposite effects on the
               marriage behavior of a sample of 400,000 women in the two
               regions: in Sub‐Saharan Africa they increase the annual hazard
               into child marriage by 3\%, while in India droughts reduce such
               a hazard by 4\%. Changes in the age of marriage due to droughts
               are associated with changes in fertility, especially in
               Sub‐Saharan Africa, and with declines in observed marriage
               payments. Our results indicate that the age of marriage responds
               to short‐term changes in aggregate economic conditions and that
               marriage payments determine the sign of this response. This
               suggests that, in order to design successful policies to combat
               child marriage and improve investments in daughters' human
               capital, it is crucial to understand the economic role of

              health, but little is known about the relationship between
              drought and intimate partner violence (IPV). We aimed to evaluate
              this relationship and to assess effect heterogeneity between
              population subgroups among women in 19 sub-Saharan African
              countries. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used data from 19 Demographic
              and Health Surveys from 2011 to 2018 including 83,990 partnered
              women aged 15-49 years. Deviations in rainfall in the year before
              the survey date were measured relative to the 29 previous years
              using Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station
              data, with recent drought classified as ordinal categorical
              variable (severe: $\leq$10th percentile; mild/moderate: >10th
              percentile to $\leq$30th percentile; none: >30th percentile). We
              considered 4 IPV-related outcomes: reporting a controlling
              partner (a risk factor for IPV) and experiencing emotional
              violence, physical violence, or sexual violence in the 12 months
              prior to survey. Logistic regression was used to estimate
              marginal risk differences (RDs). We evaluated the presence of
              effect heterogeneity by age group and employment status. Of the
              83,990 women included in the analytic sample, 10.7\% (9,019)
              experienced severe drought and 23.4\% (19,639) experienced
              mild/moderate drought in the year prior to the survey, with
              substantial heterogeneity across countries. The mean age of
              respondents was 30.8 years (standard deviation 8.2). The majority
              of women lived in rural areas (66.3\%) and were married (73.3\%),
              while less than half (42.6\%) were literate. Women living in
              severe drought had higher risk of reporting a controlling partner
              (marginal RD in percentage points = 3.0, 95\% CI 1.3, 4.6; p <
              0.001), experiencing physical violence (marginal RD = 0.8, 95\%
              CI 0.1, 1.5; p = 0.019), and experiencing sexual violence
              (marginal RD = 1.2, 95\% CI 0.4, 2.0; p = 0.001) compared with
              women not experiencing drought. Women living in mild/moderate
              drought had higher risk of reporting physical (marginal RD = 0.7,
              95\% CI 0.2, 1.1; p = 0.003) and sexual violence (marginal RD =
              0.7, 95\% CI 0.3, 1.2; p = 0.001) compared with those not living
              in drought. We did not find evidence for an association between
              drought and emotional violence. In analyses stratified by
              country, we found 3 settings where drought was protective for at
              least 1 measure of IPV: Namibia, Tanzania, and Uganda. We found
              evidence for effect heterogeneity (additive interaction) for the
              association between drought and younger age and between drought
              and employment status, with stronger associations between drought
              and IPV among adolescent girls and unemployed women. This study
              is limited by its lack of measured hypothesized mediating
              variables linking drought and IPV, prohibiting a formal mediation
              analysis. Additional limitations include the potential for bias
              due to residual confounding and potential non-differential
              misclassification of the outcome measures leading to an
              attenuation of observed associations. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings
              indicate that drought was associated with measures of IPV towards
              women, with larger positive associations among adolescent girls
              and unemployed women. There was heterogeneity in these
              associations across countries. Weather shocks may exacerbate
              vulnerabilities among women in sub-Saharan Africa. Future work
              should further evaluate potential mechanisms driving these

  abstract  = "The prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) against ever
               married women in Tanzania remains high. This has an implication
               on development at both micro and macro level given the resulting
               socio-economic costs relating to IPV. It is for this reason that
               the present study intended to examine determinants of IPV among
               married women in Tanzania. Determinants are estimated by
               analysing the 2015/16 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey
               (TDHS) data using logistic regression. Results show that risk
               factors which are positively associating with IPV include male
               partner alcohol abuse, history of domestic violence in
               childhood, years in marriage, polygamy marriage and household
               size. Meanwhile, deterrent factors comprise of the age of
               married women and male partner's education. Furthermore, results
               indicate varied determinants of different forms of IPV across
               different zone in Tanzania. It is against this backdrop that we
               recommend for policies that ensure both women and men have equal
               access to quality education; amendments of relevant laws as well
               as raising IPV awareness using zone-specific determinants to
               discourage cultural norms that condone IPV.",

               how impacts differ by program features and context. Using a
               randomized control trial, we investigate the IPV impacts of

               16 percentage points but has limited effects in nonpolygamous
               households. Evidence on mechanisms suggests that the program led
               to significant decreases in men{\^a}€™s stress and anxiety among
               polygamous households, and larger reductions in disputes in

  abstract = "There are compelling reasons to believe that orphans - many
              millions due to the AIDS epidemic - are more likely to be
              sexually victimized during childhood. Few studies have
              empirically investigated sexual violence disparities, and those
              that do suffer from methodological limitations and limited
              geographic scope. We used nationally representative data on
              female adolescents (15-17 years) from 13 countries in sub-Saharan
              Africa. We built multilevel logistic models to test for an
              association between the dependent variables (orphanhood and
              parental absence) and sexual violence, both within countries and
              pooled across all countries. Approximately 10\% of adolescent
              girls reported past experiences of sexual violence; a third of
              those victimized were 14 years or younger at the time of their
              first forced encounter. Paternal orphaning (OR 1.36,
              p$\leq$0.01), double orphaning (OR 1.47, p$\leq$0.05), and
              paternal absence (OR 1.28; p$\leq$0.05) were significantly
              associated with experiencing sexual violence in pooled analyses.
              Fewer findings reached significance within individual countries.
              Our findings suggest that the lack of a father in the home (due
              to death or absence) places girls at heightened risk for
              childhood sexual abuse; further research identifying pathways of
              vulnerability and resilience specific to this population is
              needed. Our findings also indicate that abuse often starts at an
              early age; thus promising programs should be adapted for younger
              age groups and rigorously tested.",

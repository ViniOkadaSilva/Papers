  abstract     = "This article documents the long-term impact of slavery on
                  inequality at the receiving end. We focus on Brazil, the
                  largest receiver of African slaves and the last country to
                  abolish this institution in the Western Hemisphere, in 1888.
                  To deal with the endogeneity of slavery placement, we use a
                  spatial Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), exploiting the
                  Tordesillas Treaty, which established the colonial boundaries
                  between the Portuguese and Spanish empires within Brazil. We
                  find that the number of slaves in 1872 is discontinuously
                  higher on the Portuguese side of the border, consistent with
                  this power's comparative advantage in transatlantic slavery.
                  We then show how this differential slave rate led to higher
                  modern income inequality of 0.04 points (of the Gini Index),
                  close to 10\% of the average income inequality in the
                  country. In terms of mechanisms, we find a wider income gap,
                  and important differences in education, employment and
                  prejudice for blacks in modern times. We rule out the role of
                  colonizer identity and other mechanisms proposed in the
                  historical literature.",

  title     = "Colonial Institutions, Slavery, Inequality, and Development:
               Evidence from S{\~a}o Paulo, Brazil",
  author    = "Summerhill, William",
  abstract  = "Downloadable! Brazil is frequently portrayed as exhibiting
               persistent and structural economic inequality that is rooted in
               the early colonial experience, and is believed to undermine
               development in the long run. I construct original measures of
               agricultural inequality for 1905 in what is today Brazil's
               largest state, using farm-level micro data for some 50,000
               farms. Using these measures of inequality, along with
               contemporary covariates and other historical variables I assess
               the impact of colonial institutions, slavery, farm inequality,
               and political inequality on long-term development in S{\~a}o
               Paulo. The principal findings are: (1) a potentially coercive
               colonial institution, the aldeamento, is positively correlated
               with income per capita at the end of the twentieth century; (2)
               measures of the intensity of slavery have little if any
               independent impact on income in 2000; (3) farm inequality was
               not persistent in S{\~a}o Paulo at the county level over the
               twentieth century; (4) in both OLS and IV estimates, no negative
               effect can be found for 1905 inequality on long-term
               development; (5) political inequality in the early twentieth
               century, measured by the extent of the franchise, is unrelated
               to contemporary farm inequality, and also unrelated to long-term
               economic growth; and (6) the provision of local public goods in
               the early twentieth century, measured by local public education
               outlays, has a positive impact on long-term development, but was
               not related to contemporary economic or political inequality.
               Overall, neither the intensity of slavery nor the pattern of
               inequality had any discernable negative economic impact in the
               long run.",

  abstract  = "Brazil was the American society that received the largest
               contingent of African slaves in the Americas and the longest
               lasting slave regime in the Western Hemisphere. This is the
               first complete modern survey of the institution of slavery in
               Brazil and how it affected the lives of enslaved Africans. It is
               based on major new research on the institution of slavery and
               the role of Africans and their descendants in Brazil. Although
               Brazilians have incorporated many of the North American debates
               about slavery, they have also developed a new set of questions
               about slave holding: the nature of marriage, family, religion,
               and culture among the slaves and free colored; the process of
               manumission; and the rise of the free colored class during
               slavery. It is the aim of this book to introduce the reader to
               this latest research, both to elucidate the Brazilian experience
               and to provide a basis for comparisons with all other American
               slave systems.",

  abstract  = "In this paper, we study the effects of household shocks on the
               incidence of domestic violence (DV) using a unique set of
               microdata from the World Bank's Living Standard Measurement
               Survey for Tanzania. We use idiosyncratic variation in rainfall
               as an exogenous shock to Tanzanian households and control for a
               large set of potential confounding variables on the individual,
               household and community levels, while exploiting intra-and
               inter-community rainfall variation for identification. We find
               that rainfall shocks substantially increase the likelihood of
               the DV incidence in the household. A one standard deviation
               negative rainfall shock increases the incidence of domestic
               violence by about 18.8 percentage points compared to baseline
               for wives. We furthermore show that rainfall shocks have an
               effect on physical violence, while we do not find an effect on
               severe physical or sexual abuse, which is consistent with the
               strategic use of violence. Estimates from non-linear
               specifications reveal that the overall effects are driven by
               droughts rather than floods. We furthermore show that effects
               are more pronounced for poorer households. In addition, we also
               provide evidence that female empowerment mitigates the impact of
               rainfall shocks on violence",

  title     = "Age of marriage, weather shocks, and the direction of marriage
               payments",

  abstract  = "We study how aggregate economic conditions affect the timing of
               marriage, and particularly child marriage, in Sub‐Saharan Africa
               and in India. In both regions, substantial monetary or in‐kind
               transfers occur with marriage: bride price across Sub‐Saharan
               Africa and dowry in India. In a simple equilibrium model of the
               marriage market in which parents choose when their children
               marry, income shocks affect the age of marriage because marriage
               payments are a source of consumption smoothing, particularly for
               a woman's family. As predicted by our model, we show that
               droughts, which reduce annual crop yields by 10 to 15\% and
               aggregate income by 4 to 5\%, have opposite effects on the
               marriage behavior of a sample of 400,000 women in the two
               regions: in Sub‐Saharan Africa they increase the annual hazard
               into child marriage by 3\%, while in India droughts reduce such
               a hazard by 4\%. Changes in the age of marriage due to droughts
               are associated with changes in fertility, especially in
               Sub‐Saharan Africa, and with declines in observed marriage
               payments. Our results indicate that the age of marriage responds
               to short‐term changes in aggregate economic conditions and that
               marriage payments determine the sign of this response. This
               suggests that, in order to design successful policies to combat
               child marriage and improve investments in daughters' human
               capital, it is crucial to understand the economic role of
               marriage market institutions.",

                  examine the long-term impact of Mexico's 16th-century
                  demographic collapse on landholding patterns through the
                  present day. We show that the collapse, which reduced the
                  indigenous population by between 70 and 90 percent and
                  differed in severity across space, facilitated land
                  concentration and the rise of a landowner class that dominated
                  Mexican political economy for centuries. To identify the
                  impact of the population collapse on land arrangements we use
                  an instrumental-variables identification strategy exploiting
                  climatic shocks associated with an epidemic in the 1570s that
                  roughly halved the indigenous population. Though landholding
                  patterns were transformed following the Revolution of 1910, we
                  also show that disease-impacted areas now have more land in
                  common-property institutions with limited property rights. The
                  population collapse thus had a persistent impact on Mexican
                  political economy, but the nature of this impact has changed
                  radically over time.},

                  colonies? We investigate this question in the context of the
                  Belgian Congo. Starting in the late 1920s, several colonial
                  powers in Africa feared depopulation of their colonies and
                  designed pro-birth policies. The Belgian state heavily relied
                  on Catholic nuns to implement these policies in the Congo.
                  Using a demographic survey conducted in the 1970s in seven
                  major cities, we recovered the individual birth calendars of
                  30,000 women born between 1900 and 1948, under colonial rule.
                  In addition we digitized high-quality territory level
                  information on fertility by cohort in the 1950s. We rely on
                  unique historical and archival material to reconstruct
                  temporal and geographic heterogeneity in exposure to
                  missionary presence and the type of activities performed at
                  the station level. We find a positive effect of Catholic nuns
                  on fertility. In contrast, Catholic male missionaries have no
                  detectable impact on fertility and Protestant missionaries
                  have a clear negative impact. In terms of mechanisms, we argue
                  that progress in general health are unlikely to explain,
                  alone, the rise in fertility. Another likely channel was the
                  promotion of an ideal of domesticity where women are confined
                  to their role of mother and wife. Finally, using Demographic
                  and Health Survey data, we find some trace of colonial
                  missionâ€™s influence on fertility patterns today.},

               history has been the dramatic expansion of Christianity outside

               established during colonial times as a source of exogenous
               variation to study the long-term effects of religion, human
               capital and culture in Africa, the Americas and Asia. We argue

  abstract     = {A large literature on persistence finds that many modern
                  outcomes strongly reflect characteristics of the same places
                  in the distant past. However, alongside unusually high t
                  statistics, these regressions display severe spatial
                  autocorrelation in residuals, and the purpose of this paper is
                  to examine whether these two properties might be connected. We
                  start by running artificial regressions where both variables
                  are spatial noise and find that, even for modest ranges of
                  spatial correlation between points, t statistics become
                  severely inflated leading to significance levels that are in
                  error by several orders of magnitude. We analyse 27
                  persistence studies in leading journals and find that in most
                  cases if we replace the main explanatory variable with spatial
                  noise the fit of the regression commonly improves; and if we
                  replace the dependent variable with spatial noise, the
                  persistence variable can still explain it at high significance
                  levels. We can predict in advance which persistence results
                  might be the outcome of fitting spatial noise from the degree
                  of spatial autocorrelation in their residuals measured by a
                  standard Moran statistic. Our findings suggest that the
                  results of persistence studies, and of spatial regressions
                  more generally, might be treated with some caution in the
                  absence of reported Moran statistics and noise simulations.},

               Amazonian economy (1720-1822), the role of the religious orders
               and trade companies, and the formation of a caboclo-peasantry.

               (1850-1920), based on classical and unprecedented data and
               considering the role of both the caboclo-peasants and the big

               a pioneering analysis of the rural and urban dynamics of the
               post-rubber boom era which lasted until the 1960s. Considering

                  (see expression (2.1)), provided that a number of the

                  Under the assumption of the knowledge of all variables in the
                  system and the assumption that the disturbances in the
                  equations of the system are normally distributed, point
                  estimates are derived from the regressions of the jointly
                  dependent variables on the predetermined variables (Theorem
                  1). The vector of the estimates of the coefficients of the
                  jointly dependent variables is the characteristic vector of a
                  matrix involving the regression coefficients and the estimate
                  of the covariance matrix of the residuals from the regression
                  functions. The vector corresponding to the smallest
                  characteristic root is taken. An efficient method of computing
                  these estimates is given in section 7. The asymptotic theory
                  of these estimates is given in a following paper [2]. When the
                  predetermined variables can be considered as fixed, confidence
                  regions for the coefficients can be obtained on the basis of
                  small sample theory (Theorem 3). A statistical test for the
                  hypothesis of over-identification of the single equation can
                  be based on the characteristic root associated with the vector
                  of point estimates (Theorem 2) or on the expression for the
                  small sample confidence region (Theorem 4). This hypothesis is
                  equivalent to the hypothesis that the coefficients assumed to
                  be zero actually are zero. The asymptotic distribution of the
                  criterion is shown in a following paper [2] to be that of χ2.]}

               historical presence of European missionaries is an important
               factor affecting economic development across the globe today. The
               causal mechanism that has received the most attention, and the
               most empirical support, is education. The presence of Christian
               missionaries, particularly Protestant missionaries, has been
               shown to be strongly correlated with increased educational
               attainment, and the effects appear to persist for many
               generations (Bai and Kung 2011; Grier 1997; Woodberry 2004,
               2009). The education-promoting influence of Protestant
               missionaries is not surprising given the evidence that the rise
               of Protestantism within Europe had long-term education (and
               economic growth) promoting effects (Becker and Woessmann 2009,
               2008, 2010; Schaltegger and Torgler 2009).This study provides
               evidence for the long-term impact of colonial missionary activity
               within Africa. The analysis uses data on the location of
               Protestant and Catholic missions from a map titled “Ethnographic
               Survey of Africa: Showing the Tribes and Languages; also the
               Stations of Missionary Societies” published by William Roome
               (1924). This information, combined with data on the locations of
               ethnic groups from Murdock (1959), is used to calculate estimates
               of the exposure of African ethnic groups to missionary activity.},

                  different regions. The first region has been settled by
                  Europeans since the 16th century, while European settlement in
                  the second region was interrupted after a 17th-century slave

                  higher population density and urbanization in the first

                  were all Catholic, but they belonged to different monastic
                  traditions and adhered to different values. Mendicant orders
                  were committed to poverty and sought to reduce social
                  inequality in colonial Mexico by educating the native
                  population. The Jesuit order, by contrast, focused educational
                  efforts on the colony's elite in the city centers, rather than
                  on the native population in rural mission areas. Using a newly
                  constructed data set of the locations of 1,145 missions in
                  colonial Mexico, I test whether long-run development outcomes
                  differ among areas that had Mendicant missions, Jesuit
                  missions, or no missions. Results indicate that areas with

                  in February 1942 which severed access to traditional latex
                  markets, the United States subsidized mass labor transfers
                  from the Brazilian Northeast to the Amazon forest to increase
                  rubber output. The regime of Getulio Vargas, which favored
                  Northeastern migration as a geopolitical measure to occupy the
                  frontier and as a safety valve for the drought-stricken
                  backlands, promised protective measures and financial gain to
                  workers. Whereas postwar revisionist scholarship has tended to
                  view migrants as stupefied by drought and duped by regime
                  propaganda, this essay argues that labor flows to the Amazon
                  must be understood in the context of broader historical
                  patterns of Northeastern migration to the Amazon; the
                  socioeconomic inequalities of the Northeast and the
                  differential impact of drought on its peasantry; state

                  the margins of the Brazilian nation-state and Allied military

               social and environmental history to connect them intimately to
               the natural landscape and to Indigenous peoples. Relying on this
               world as a repository for traditions, discourses, and strategies
               that they retrieved especially in moments of conflict,
               Afro-Brazilians fought for autonomous communities and developed a
               vibrant ethnic identity that supported their struggles over
               labor, land, and citizenship. Prior to abolition, enslaved and
               escaped blacks found in the tropical forest a source for tools,
               weapons, and trade--but it was also a cultural storehouse within
               which they shaped their stories and records of confrontations
               with slaveowners and state authorities. After abolition, the
               black peasants' knowledge of local environments continued to be
               key to their aspirations, allowing them to maintain relationships
               with powerful patrons and to participate in the protest cycle
               that led Getulio Vargas to the presidency of Brazil in 1930. In
               commonly referring to themselves by such names as "sons of the
               river," black Amazonians melded their agro-ecological traditions
               with their emergent identity as political stakeholders.},

               its expulsion from the Portuguese world. A second volume will
               examine the Orders expulsion, the fate of its members, and the
               disposition of its assets in Portugal and her empire from 1750 to
               1808. The present volume begins with the Societys introduction
               to Portugal and traces its expansion throughout what the Society
               defined as the Portuguese Assistancy, a vast complex of
               administrative units that included the kingdom of Portugal and
               her empire plus portions of the Indian subcontinent, Japan,
               China, the Indonesian archipelago, and Ethiopia. Though it fully
               describes the evangelical and educational activities of the
               Jesuits, the book emphasizes their political relations with
               Portuguese and indigenous leaders, the founding of their major
               training facilities, the development of their economic
               infrastructure, their activities as governmental administrators

              statistical inference is challenging since unobserved
              heterogeneity can be correlated across neighboring observational
              units. We develop an estimator for the variance-covariance matrix
              (VCV) of OLS and 2SLS that allows for arbitrary dependence of the
              errors across observations in space or network structure, and
              across time periods. As a proof of concept, we conduct Monte Carlo
              simulations in a geospatial setting based on US Metropolitan
              areas; tests based on our estimator of the VCV asymptotically
              correctly reject the null hypothesis where conventional inference
              methods, e.g. those without clusters, or with clusters based on
              administrative units, reject the null hypothesis too often. We
              also provide simulations in a network setting based on the IDEAS
              structure of co-authorship and real life data on scientific
              performance; the Monte Carlo results again show that our estimator
              yields inference at the right significance level already in
              moderately sized samples, and it dominates other commonly used
              approaches to inference in networks. We provide guidance to the
              applied researcher with respect to (i) including or not
              potentially correlated regressors and (ii) choice of cluster
              bandwidth. Finally we provide a companion statistical package

               to argue that indigenous mobility did not undermine settlement or
               community. In doing so, it revises longstanding views of native
               Amazonians as perpetual wanderers, lacking attachment to place
               and likely to flee at the slightest provocation. Instead, native
               Amazonians used traditional as well as new, colonial forms of
               spatial mobility to build enduring communities under the
               constraints of Portuguese colonialism. Canoeing and trekking
               through the interior to collect forest products or to contact
               independent native groups, Indians expanded their social
               networks, found economic opportunities, and brought new people
               and resources back to the colonial villages. When they were not
               participating in these state-sponsored expeditions, many Indians
               migrated between colonial settlements, seeking to be incorporated
               as productive members of their chosen communities. Drawing on
               largely untapped village-level sources, the book shows that
               mobile people remained attached to their home communities and
               committed to the preservation of their lands and assets. This
               argument still matters today, and not just to scholars, as rural
               communities in the Brazilian Amazon find themselves threatened by
               powerful outsiders who argue that their mobility invalidates
               their claims to territory.},

  abstract  = {ENTRE A CRUZ, A FLECHA E A ESPADA pretende ser de alguma
               contribuição para as investigações ainda pouco frequentes sobre o
               protagonismo das Missões Carmelitas na Amazônia Portuguesa no
               período colonial. Apesar de haverem tido papel importante na
               colonização portuguesa do que hoje é a Amazônia Brasileira,
               especialmente na configuração daquele que hoje é geograficamente
               o maior Estado brasileiro - o Amazonas -, os Carmelitas ainda
               são, entretanto, quase desconhecidos pelos estudiosos da história
               amazonense e amazônida como um todo. No presente livro, os
               Carmelitas são apresentados desde sua chegada à Amazônia no
               primeiro capítulo, passando por sua chegada à Amazônia Ocidental
               no segundo capítulo até o final de suas seis décadas de atuação
               nesta região, entre 1695 até 1755, quando as missões foram
               extintas por ordem da Coroa portuguesa, o que é abordado ao final
               do último capítulo. Importante temática abordada neste trabalho,
               dentre outras, é a da participação dos Carmelitas em situações
               decisivas do rio Negro e do Solimões por meio de sua atuação
               missionária: os inícios do Lugar da Barra, atual Manaus; a
               participação controversa na guerra aos Manau e outras nações
               indígenas; e o episódio Samuel Fritz com todas as conseqüências
               para a ampliação das fronteiras portuguesas na Amazônia.
               Destaca-se neste livro, especialmente nos dois últimos capítulos,
               a importância de Fr. Victoriano Pimentel e a significativa
               documentação que legou à historiografia de sua ordem na Amazônia.
               Ao final se dá um destaque a aspectos positivos da presença dos
               Camelitas na Amazônia, não obstante as acusações que lhes
               imputaram de traição à sua missão religiosa e perversão no
               acúmulo de terras, drogas do sertão e escravos para sua ordem.},

                  SRTM4.1dev to derive a suite of topographic variables:

                  floodplains. However, a spatial gap in the archaeological
                  record of the Amazon has limited the assessment of the

                  discovery of Pre-Columbian ditched enclosures in the Tapajós

                  southern Amazonia was occupied by earth-building cultures
                  living in fortified villages ~Cal AD 1250-1500. We model

                  for former slaves and their children and grandchildren to
                  outcomes for free blacks (pre-1865) and their children and
                  grandchildren. The outcome measures include literacy, whether
                  a child attends school, months spent in school, years of
                  schooling, and two measures of adult occupation. Using a
                  variety of different comparisons (for example, within versus
                  across regions) I find that it took roughly two generations
                  for the descendants of slaves to catch up to the descendants
                  of free black men and women, for those outcomes that I
                  observe. In other words, by 1920 the remaining legacy of
                  slavery is such that all blacks are affected equally, not just
                  the actual descendants of slaves. There is some evidence that
                  this convergence was facilitated by intermarriage among slave
                  and free families. The finding of convergence is consistent
                  with modern estimates and interpretations of father-son
                  correlations in income and socioeconomic status. The data used

                  and is influential in global carbon and hydrological cycles.
                  Whether ancient Amazonia was highly disturbed or modestly
                  impacted, and how ancient disturbances have shaped current
                  forest ecosystem processes, is still under debate. Amazonian
                  Dark Earths (ADEs), which are anthropic soil types with
                  enriched nutrient levels, are one of the primary lines of
                  evidence for ancient human presence and landscape
                  modifications in settings that mostly lack stone structures
                  and which are today covered by vegetation. We assessed the
                  potential of using moderate spatial resolution optical
                  satellite imagery to predict ADEs across the Amazon Basin.
                  Maximum entropy modeling was used to develop a predictive
                  model using locations of ADEs across the basin and
                  satellite‐derived remotely sensed indices. Amazonian Dark
                  Earth sites were predicted to be primarily along the main
                  rivers and in eastern Amazonia. Amazonian Dark Earth sites,
                  when compared with randomly selected forested sites located
                  within 50 km of ADE sites, were less green canopies (lower
                  normalized difference vegetation index) and had lower canopy
                  water content. This difference was accentuated in two drought
                  years, 2005 and 2010. This is contrary to our expectation that
                  ADE sites would have nutrient‐rich soils that support trees
                  with greener canopies and forests on ADE soils being more
                  resilient to drought. Biomass and tree height were lower on
                  ADE sites in comparison with randomly selected adjacent sites.
                  Our results suggested that ADE‐related ancient human impact on
                  the forest is measurable across the entirety of the 6 million
                  km2 of Amazon Basin using remotely sensed data.},

                  given the relative lower fertility of the majority of
                  Amazonian soils in which they are embedded because of their
                  improved agricultural potential and also because of their
                  links to Amazonian pre-colonial history. Because of their
                  small individual extent and local nature, documenting where
                  these soils are located in the Amazon is a challenging task.
                  Few comprehensive maps exist, and some locations are only
                  approximate. In this article we present an interactive GIS in
                  which we have tried to consolidate all known locations of ADEs
                  to date, and to note for each location a level of accuracy and
                  specificity of both the soil and its location. This is
                  necessary as many older sources of locations are historical
                  and give only an approximation of where they are. For more
                  recent ADE citations, the geo-referenced location is given
                  when available. The source citation is given for each location
                  on the map, making this interactive GIS at once also a
                  bibliography of Amazonian Dark Earth locations. We also
                  discuss the selection of the cited locations, the creation of
                  the GIS, and reflect on the potential uses of the resource. We
                  acknowledge that the GIS is a work in progress, and we
                  anticipate keeping it updated as more materials are published
                  and otherwise made available. Terras pretas são solos

  abstract     = {During the twentieth century, Amazonia was widely regarded as
                  relatively pristine nature, little impacted by human history.
                  This view remains popular despite mounting evidence of
                  substantial human influence over millennial scales across the
                  region. Here, we review the evidence of an anthropogenic
                  Amazonia in response to claims of sparse populations across
                  broad portions of the region. Amazonia was a major centre of
                  crop domestication, with at least 83 native species containing
                  populations domesticated to some degree. Plant domestication
                  occurs in domesticated landscapes, including highly modified
                  Amazonian dark earths (ADEs) associated with large settled
                  populations and that may cover greater than 0.1\% of the
                  region. Populations and food production expanded rapidly
                  within land management systems in the mid-Holocene, and
                  complex societies expanded in resource-rich areas creating
                  domesticated landscapes with profound impacts on local and
                  regional ecology. ADE food production projections support
                  estimates of at least eight million people in 1492. By this
                  time, highly diverse regional systems had developed across
                  Amazonia where subsistence resources were created with plant
                  and landscape domestication, including earthworks. This review
                  argues that the Amazonian anthrome was no less
                  socio-culturally diverse or populous than other tropical
                  forested areas of the world prior to European conquest.},

               followed by possibly the greatest demographic disaster in the
               history of the world." Research by some scholars provides
               population estimates of the pre-contact Americas to be as high as
               112 million in 1492, while others estimate the population to have
               been as low as eight million. In any case, the native population
               declined to less than six million by 1650. In this collection of
               essays, historians, anthropologists, and geographers discuss the
               discrepancies in the population estimates and the evidence for
               the post-European decline. Woodrow Borah, Angel Rosenblat,
               William T. Sanders, and others touch on such topics as the Indian
               slave trade, diseases, military action, and the disruption of the
               social systems of the native peoples. Offering varying points of
               view, the contributors critically analyze major hemispheric and
               regional data and estimates for pre- and post-European contact.
               This revised edition features a new introduction by Denevan
               reviewing recent literature and providing a new hemispheric
               estimate of 54 million, a foreword by W. George Lovell of Queen's
               University, and a comprehensive updating of the already extensive

               contributions from many disciplines. The discussions and essays
               presented here can serve both as an overview of past estimates,
               conflicts, and methods and as indicators of new approaches and

               sociohistorical linguists working across the region, Salikoko S.
               Mufwene does just that in this book. Exploring the many different

               cultures, the contributors identify the crucial parameters of
               language evolution that have led to today’s state of linguistic
               diversity in Latin America. The essays approach language
               development through an ecological lens, exploring the effects of
               politics, economics, cultural contact, and natural resources on
               the indigenization of Spanish and Portuguese in a variety of
               local settings. They show how languages adapt to new
               environments, peoples, and practices, and the ramifications of
               this for the spread of colonial languages, the loss or survival
               of indigenous ones, and the way hybrid vernaculars get situated
               in larger political and cultural forces. The result is a

                  characterised by elevated concentrations of microscopic
                  charcoal particles, which confer their distinctive
                  colouration. Frequent occurrences of pre-Columbian artefacts
                  at ADE sites led to their ubiquitous classification as
                  Anthrosols (soils of anthropic origin). However, it remains
                  unclear how indigenous peoples created areas of high fertility
                  in one of the most nutrient-impoverished environments on
                  Earth. Here, we report new data from a well-studied ADE site
                  in the Brazilian Amazon, which compel us to reconsider its
                  anthropic origin. The amounts of phosphorus and calcium-two of
                  the least abundant macronutrients in the region-are orders of
                  magnitude higher in ADE profiles than in the surrounding soil.
                  The elevated levels of phosphorus and calcium, which are often
                  interpreted as evidence of human activity at other sites,
                  correlate spatially with trace elements that indicate
                  exogenous mineral sources rather than in situ deposition.
                  Stable isotope ratios of neodymium, strontium, and radiocarbon
                  activity of microcharcoal particles also indicate exogenous
                  inputs from alluvial deposition of carbon and mineral elements
                  to ADE profiles, beginning several thousands of years before
                  the earliest evidence of soil management for plant cultivation
                  in the region. Our data suggest that indigenous peoples
                  harnessed natural processes of landscape formation, which led
                  to the unique properties of ADEs, but were not responsible for
                  their genesis. If corroborated elsewhere, this hypothesis
                  would transform our understanding of human influence in
                  Amazonia, opening new frontiers for the sustainable use of
                  tropical landscapes going forward.},

                  Amazonia have remained uncertain and controversial. Various
                  indicators can be used to gauge the impact of pre-Columbian
                  societies, but the formation of nutrient-enriched terra preta
                  soils has been widely accepted as an indication of long-term
                  settlement and site fidelity. Using known and newly discovered
                  terra preta sites and maximum entropy algorithms (Maxent), we
                  determined the influence of regional environmental conditions
                  on the likelihood that terra pretas would have been formed at
                  any given location in lowland Amazonia. Terra pretas were most
                  frequently found in central and eastern Amazonia along the
                  lower courses of the major Amazonian rivers. Terrain,
                  hydrologic and soil characteristics were more important

                  conditions. Our modelling efforts indicated that terra pretas

                  the forest. We also predict that terra preta formation was
                  limited in most of western Amazonia. Model results suggested
                  that the distribution of terra preta was highly predictable
                  based on environmental parameters. We provided targets for
                  future archaeological surveys under the vast forest canopy and
                  also highlighted how few of the long-term forest inventory

                  America during the Late Holocene has long been connected to

                  the Late Holocene are assumed to have driven the expansion of
                  forests, which would have facilitated the dispersal of
                  cultures that practised agroforestry. The Tupi, a language
                  family of widespread distribution in South America, occupies a
                  central place in the debate. Not only are they one of the
                  largest families in the continent, but their expansion from an
                  Amazonian homeland has long been hypothesized to have followed
                  forested environments wherever they settled. Here, we assess
                  that hypothesis using a simulation approach. We employ
                  equation-based and cellular automaton models, simulating
                  demic-diffusion processes under two different scenarios: a
                  null model in which all land cells can be equally settled, and
                  an alternative model in which non-forested cells cannot be
                  settled or delay the expansion. We show that including land
                  cover as a constraint to movement results in a better
                  approximation of the Tupi expansion as reconstructed by
                  archaeology and linguistics.},

                  budget, estimates of tree biodiversity originate from fewer
                  than 1,000 forest inventory plots, and estimates of carbon
                  dynamics are derived from fewer than 200 recensus plots. It is
                  well documented that the pre-European inhabitants of Amazonia
                  actively transformed and modified the forest in many regions
                  before their population collapse around 1491 AD; however, the
                  impacts of these ancient disturbances remain entirely
                  unaccounted for in the many highly influential studies using
                  Amazonian forest plots. Here we examine whether Amazonian
                  forest inventory plot locations are spatially biased toward
                  areas with high probability of ancient human impacts. Our
                  analyses reveal that forest inventory plots, and especially
                  forest recensus plots, in all regions of Amazonia are located
                  disproportionately near archaeological evidence and in areas
                  likely to have ancient human impacts. Furthermore, regions of
                  the Amazon that are relatively oversampled with inventory
                  plots also contain the highest values of predicted ancient
                  human impacts. Given the long lifespan of Amazonian trees,
                  many forest inventory and recensus sites may still be
                  recovering from past disturbances, potentially skewing our
                  interpretations of forest dynamics and our understanding of
                  how these forests are responding to global change. Empirical
                  data on the human history of forest inventory sites are
                  crucial for determining how past disturbances affect modern
                  patterns of forest composition and carbon flux in Amazonian
                  forests.},

                  the health facilities they invested in, that we combine with

                  First, we show that proximity to historical missionary health
                  facilities decreases the likelihood of HIV; persistence in

                  the provision of public goods. Competition between religious

                  we test the ?colonial human capital? explanation for
                  sub-Saharan Africa, controlling for legal origin and
                  geography. Utilising data on colonial era education, we find

                  long-term growth runs through a human capital channel rather
                  than an extractive-institutions channel. The effect of

               (Jesuits) has been praised as a saintly god-send and condemned as
               the work of Satan. With some 600 entries written by 110 authors -
               those inside and outside the order - this encyclopedia opens up
               the complexities of Jesuit history and explores the current life
               and work of this Catholic religious order and its global
               vocation. Approximately 230 entries are biographies, focusing on
               key people in Jesuit history, while the majority of the entries
               focus on Jesuit ideals, concepts, terminology, places,
               institutions, and events. With some 70 illustrations highlighting
               the centrality of visual images in Jesuit life, this encyclopedia
               is a comprehensive volume providing accessible and authoritative
               coverage of the Jesuits' life and work across the continents
               during the last five centuries.},

                  Historical persistence refers to causal effects that (a)
                  operate over time scales of a decade or more and (b) explain
                  spatial variation in political, economic, or social outcomes.
                  Although political scientists have always drawn from history,
                  the historical persistence literature represents a new
                  approach to historical research in the social sciences that
                  places a premium on credible research designs for causal
                  inference. We discuss regional and national coverage,

                  challenges, and mechanisms and theories of persistence,

  abstract = {This article documents the long-term impact of slavery on
              inequality at the receiving end. We focus on Brazil, the largest
              receiver of African slaves and the last country to abolish this
              institution in the Western Hemisphere, in 1888. To deal with the
              endogeneity of slavery placement, we use a spatial Regression
              Discontinuity Design (RDD), exploiting the Tordesillas Treaty,
              which established the colonial boundaries between the Portuguese
              and Spanish empires within Brazil. We find that the number of
              slaves in 1872 is discontinuously higher on the Portuguese side of
              the border, consistent with this power's comparative advantage in
              transatlantic slavery. We then show how this differential slave
              rate led to higher modern income inequality of 0.04 points (of the
              Gini Index), close to 10\% of the average income inequality in the
              country. In terms of mechanisms, we find a wider income gap, and
              important differences in education, employment and prejudice for
              blacks in modern times. We rule out the role of colonizer identity

                  development within Brazil. I first exploit variation in
                  temperature and precipitation to instrument for the local
                  distribution of land in 1920 using a two stage least squares
                  instrumental variables framework. My instrument is an index
                  quantifying the suitability of local climatic conditions for
                  plantation versus smallholder agriculture. I construct this
                  index using information on the growing conditions of crops
                  within certain plant taxonomies that are more biologically
                  suited for smallholder or plantation production. I argue that
                  this index more fully identifies the optimal environmental
                  conditions for these two types of agricultural production, and
                  I show that it serves as a robust predictor of local land
                  inequality in the year 1920. IV estimates then reveal that
                  greater inequality is associated with less local government
                  spending on welfare and public goods over the 1995-2005 time
                  period, as well as reductions in measures of local government
                  quality and per-child education spending. It is also
                  associated with lower levels of development, as measured by
                  the local Human Development Index (HDI) for the year 2000.
                  Inequality primarily affects the HDI through shorter life
                  expectancies and lower incomes. I argue that the latter is
                  consistent with the agrarian elite obstructing the transition
                  of the local economy from agriculture to industry/services, as
                  historically unequal municipalities contain a greater
                  percentage of workers in the lower-wage agriculture sector,
                  and this sector itself constitutes a larger share of local
                  GDP.}

  abstract  = {The Amazon, the world's largest rain forest, is the last frontier
               in Brazil. The settlement of large and small farmers, squatters,
               miners, and loggers in this frontier during the past thirty years
               has given rise to violent conflicts over land as well as
               environmental duress. Titles, Conflict, and Land Use examines the
               institutional development involved in the process of land use and
               ownership in the Amazon and shows how this phenomenon affects the
               behavior of the economic actors. It explores the way in which the
               absence of well-defined property rights in the Amazon has led to
               both economic and social problems, including lost investment
               opportunities, high costs in protecting claims, and violence. The
               relationship between land reform and violence is given special
               attention. The book offers an important application of the New
               Institutional Economics by examining a rare instance where
               institutional change can be empirically observed. This allows the
               authors to study property rights as they emerge and evolve and to
               analyze the effects of Amazon development on the economy. In
               doing so they illustrate well the point that often the evolution
               of economic institutions will not lead to efficient outcomes.
               This book will be important not only to economists but also to
               Latin Americanists, political scientists, anthropologists, and
               scholars in disciplines concerned with the environment. Lee

  abstract  = "William M. Denevan writes that, ``The discovery of America was
               followed by possibly the greatest demographic disaster in the
               history of the world.'' Research by some scholars provides
               population estimates of the pre-contact Americas to be as high
               as 112 million in 1492, while others estimate the population to
               have been as low as eight million. In any case, the native
               population declined to less than six million by 1650. In this
               collection of essays, historians, anthropologists, and
               geographers discuss the discrepancies in the population
               estimates and the evidence for the post-European decline.
               Woodrow Borah, Angel Rosenblat, William T. Sanders, and others
               touch on such topics as the Indian slave trade, diseases,
               military action, and the disruption of the social systems of the
               native peoples. Offering varying points of view, the
               contributors critically analyze major hemispheric and regional
               data and estimates for pre- and post-European contact. This
               revised edition features a new introduction by Denevan reviewing
               recent literature and providing a new hemispheric estimate of 54
               million, a foreword by W. George Lovell of Queen's University,
               and a comprehensive updating of the already extensive
               bibliography. Research in this subject is accelerating, with
               contributions from many disciplines. The discussions and essays
               presented here can serve both as an overview of past estimates,
               conflicts, and methods and as indicators of new approaches and
               perspectives to this timely subject.",

               political science and the related social sciences. Historical
               persistence refers to causal effects that (a) operate over time
               scales of a decade or more and (b) explain spatial variation in
               political, economic, or social outcomes. Although political
               scientists have always drawn from history, the historical
               persistence literature represents a new approach to historical
               research in the social sciences that places a premium on
               credible research designs for causal inference. We discuss

               three chapters focusing on fundamental periods. The first
               section provides a unique discussion of the dynamics of the
               colonial Amazonian economy (1720-1822), the role of the
               religious orders and trade companies, and the formation of a
               caboclo-peasantry. This is followed by an original analysis of
               the rubber economy (1850-1920), based on classical and
               unprecedented data and considering the role of both the
               caboclo-peasants and the big rubber plots in the mercantile
               chains. The third chapter presents a pioneering analysis of the
               rural and urban dynamics of the post-rubber boom era which
               lasted until the 1960s. Considering the interest that the Amazon
               arouses around the world, the book will appeal to the general
               public, and will also draw particular attention from economists,

  abstract  = "Based on more than two decades of research conducted on five
               continents, this monumental work focuses on the activities of
               members of the Society of Jesus from its foundation to the eve
               of its expulsion from the Portuguese world. A second volume will
               examine the Orders expulsion, the fate of its members, and the
               disposition of its assets in Portugal and her empire from 1750
               to 1808. The present volume begins with the Societys
               introduction to Portugal and traces its expansion throughout
               what the Society defined as the Portuguese Assistancy, a vast
               complex of administrative units that included the kingdom of
               Portugal and her empire plus portions of the Indian
               subcontinent, Japan, China, the Indonesian archipelago, and
               Ethiopia. Though it fully describes the evangelical and
               educational activities of the Jesuits, the book emphasizes their
               political relations with Portuguese and indigenous leaders, the
               founding of their major training facilities, the development of
               their economic infrastructure, their activities as governmental
               administrators for the Portuguese in India and China, and their
               role in Portugals unsuccessful attempts to preserve her eastern
               empire and to revive Brazil after the Dutch occupation
               (1630-1654). Throughout, the author makes insightful comparisons

               Portuguese Assistancy and between the Jesuits and their monastic
               predecessors in various parts of Europe, notably France and

               to argue that indigenous mobility did not undermine settlement
               or community. In doing so, it revises longstanding views of
               native Amazonians as perpetual wanderers, lacking attachment to
               place and likely to flee at the slightest provocation. Instead,
               native Amazonians used traditional as well as new, colonial
               forms of spatial mobility to build enduring communities under
               the constraints of Portuguese colonialism. Canoeing and trekking
               through the interior to collect forest products or to contact
               independent native groups, Indians expanded their social
               networks, found economic opportunities, and brought new people
               and resources back to the colonial villages. When they were not
               participating in these state-sponsored expeditions, many Indians
               migrated between colonial settlements, seeking to be
               incorporated as productive members of their chosen communities.
               Drawing on largely untapped village-level sources, the book
               shows that mobile people remained attached to their home
               communities and committed to the preservation of their lands and
               assets. This argument still matters today, and not just to
               scholars, as rural communities in the Brazilian Amazon find
               themselves threatened by powerful outsiders who argue that their
               mobility invalidates their claims to territory.",

  abstract  = "One of the most powerful cultural transformations in modern
               history has been the dramatic expansion of Christianity outside
               Europe. Recent, yet extensive, literature uses Christian
               missions established during colonial times as a source of
               exogenous variation to study the long-term effects of religion,
               human capital and culture in Africa, the Americas and Asia. We
               argue that the endogeneity of missionary expansion may be
               underestimated, thus questioning the link between missions and
               economic development. Using annual panel data on missions from
               1751 to 1932 in Ghana as well as cross-sectional data on
               missions for 43 sub-Saharan African countries in 1900 and 1924,
               we show that: (i) locational decisions were driven by economic
               factors, as missionaries went to healthier, safer, and more
               accessible and developed areas, privileging the best locations
               first; (ii) these factors may spuriously explain why locations
               with past missions are more developed today, especially as most
               studies rely on historical mission atlases that tend to only
               report the best mission locations. Our study identifies factors
               behind the spatial diffusion of religion. It also highlights the
               risks of omission and endogenous measurement error biases when
               using historical data and events for identification.",

              distant past. However, alongside unusually high t statistics,
              these regressions display severe spatial autocorrelation in
              residuals, and the purpose of this paper is to examine whether
              these two properties might be connected. We start by running
              artificial regressions where both variables are spatial noise and
              find that, even for modest ranges of spatial correlation between
              points, t statistics become severely inflated leading to
              significance levels that are in error by several orders of
              magnitude. We analyse 27 persistence studies in leading journals
              and find that in most cases if we replace the main explanatory
              variable with spatial noise the fit of the regression commonly
              improves; and if we replace the dependent variable with spatial
              noise, the persistence variable can still explain it at high
              significance levels. We can predict in advance which persistence
              results might be the outcome of fitting spatial noise from the
              degree of spatial autocorrelation in their residuals measured by
              a standard Moran statistic. Our findings suggest that the results

               factor affecting economic development across the globe today.
               The causal mechanism that has received the most attention, and
               the most empirical support, is education. The presence of
               Christian missionaries, particularly Protestant missionaries,
               has been shown to be strongly correlated with increased
               educational attainment, and the effects appear to persist for
               many generations (Bai and Kung 2011; Grier 1997; Woodberry 2004,
               2009). The education-promoting influence of Protestant
               missionaries is not surprising given the evidence that the rise
               of Protestantism within Europe had long-term education (and
               economic growth) promoting effects (Becker and Woessmann 2009,
               2008, 2010; Schaltegger and Torgler 2009).This study provides
               evidence for the long-term impact of colonial missionary
               activity within Africa. The analysis uses data on the location
               of Protestant and Catholic missions from a map titled
               ``Ethnographic Survey of Africa: Showing the Tribes and
               Languages; also the Stations of Missionary Societies'' published
               by William Roome (1924). This information, combined with data on
               the locations of ethnic groups from Murdock (1959), is used to

              missionary orders in colonial Mexico on educational outcomes and
              Catholicism. The main missionary orders in colonial Mexico were
              all Catholic, but they belonged to different monastic traditions
              and adhered to different values. Mendicant orders were committed
              to poverty and sought to reduce social inequality in colonial
              Mexico by educating the native population. The Jesuit order, by
              contrast, focused educational efforts on the colony's elite in
              the city centers, rather than on the native population in rural
              mission areas. Using a newly constructed data set of the
              locations of 1,145 missions in colonial Mexico, I test whether
              long-run development outcomes differ among areas that had
              Mendicant missions, Jesuit missions, or no missions. Results
              indicate that areas with historical Mendicant missions have
              higher present-day literacy rates, and higher rates of
              educational attainment at primary, secondary and post-secondary
              levels than regions without a mission. Results show that the
              share of Catholics is higher in regions where Catholic missions
              of any kind were a historical present. Additional results suggest
              that missionaries may have affected long-term development by

              contemporary era. It advances and empirically establishes the
              hypothesis that, in the course of the exodus of Homo sapiens out
              of Africa, variation in migratory distance from the cradle of
              humankind to various settlements across the globe affected
              genetic diversity and has had a long-lasting effect on the

               Torre focuses on the experience of African-descended people
               navigating the transition from slavery to freedom. He draws on
               social and environmental history to connect them intimately to
               the natural landscape and to Indigenous peoples. Relying on this
               world as a repository for traditions, discourses, and strategies
               that they retrieved especially in moments of conflict,
               Afro-Brazilians fought for autonomous communities and developed
               a vibrant ethnic identity that supported their struggles over
               labor, land, and citizenship. Prior to abolition, enslaved and
               escaped blacks found in the tropical forest a source for tools,
               weapons, and trade--but it was also a cultural storehouse within
               which they shaped their stories and records of confrontations
               with slaveowners and state authorities. After abolition, the
               black peasants' knowledge of local environments continued to be
               key to their aspirations, allowing them to maintain
               relationships with powerful patrons and to participate in the
               protest cycle that led Getulio Vargas to the presidency of
               Brazil in 1930. In commonly referring to themselves by such
               names as ``sons of the river,'' black Amazonians melded their
               agro-ecological traditions with their emergent identity as
               political stakeholders.",

              statistical inference is challenging since unobserved
              heterogeneity can be correlated across neighboring observational
              units. We develop an estimator for the variance-covariance matrix
              (VCV) of OLS and 2SLS that allows for arbitrary dependence of the
              errors across observations in space or network structure, and
              across time periods. As a proof of concept, we conduct Monte
              Carlo simulations in a geospatial setting based on US
              Metropolitan areas; tests based on our estimator of the VCV
              asymptotically correctly reject the null hypothesis where
              conventional inference methods, e.g. those without clusters, or
              with clusters based on administrative units, reject the null
              hypothesis too often. We also provide simulations in a network
              setting based on the IDEAS structure of co-authorship and real
              life data on scientific performance; the Monte Carlo results

              genetic ancestry estimates for different Brazilian geographic
              regions and analyze factors involved in these estimates. In this
              systematic scoping review were included 51 studies, comprehending
              81 populations of 19 states from five regions of Brazil. To
              reduce the potential of bias from studies with different sampling
              methods, we calculated the mean genetic ancestry weighted by the
              number of individuals. The weighted mean proportions of European,
              African, and Native American ancestries were 68.1\%, 19.6\%, and
              11.6\%, respectively. At the regional level, the highest European
              contribution occurred in the South, while the highest African and

               generation's future sons, daughters, grandsons, and
               granddaughters? I study this question by comparing outcomes for
               former slaves and their children and grandchildren to outcomes
               for free blacks (pre-1865) and their children and grandchildren.
               The outcome measures include literacy, whether a child attends
               school, months spent in school, years of schooling, and two
               measures of adult occupation. Using a variety of different
               comparisons (for example, within versus across regions) I find
               that it took roughly two generations for the descendants of
               slaves to catch up to the descendants of free black men and
               women, for those outcomes that I observe. In other words, by
               1920 the remaining legacy of slavery is such that all blacks are
               affected equally, not just the actual descendants of slaves.
               There is some evidence that this convergence was facilitated by
               intermarriage among slave and free families. The finding of
               convergence is consistent with modern estimates and

  abstract  = "Amazonia contains a vast expanse of contiguous tropical forest
               and is influential in global carbon and hydrological cycles.
               Whether ancient Amazonia was highly disturbed or modestly
               impacted, and how ancient disturbances have shaped current
               forest ecosystem processes, is still under debate. Amazonian
               Dark Earths (ADEs), which are anthropic soil types with enriched
               nutrient levels, are one of the primary lines of evidence for
               ancient human presence and landscape modifications in settings
               that mostly lack stone structures and which are today covered by
               vegetation. We assessed the potential of using moderate spatial
               resolution optical satellite imagery to predict ADEs across the
               Amazon Basin. Maximum entropy modeling was used to develop a
               predictive model using locations of ADEs across the basin and
               satellite‐derived remotely sensed indices. Amazonian Dark Earth
               sites were predicted to be primarily along the main rivers and
               in eastern Amazonia. Amazonian Dark Earth sites, when compared
               with randomly selected forested sites located within 50 km of
               ADE sites, were less green canopies (lower normalized difference
               vegetation index) and had lower canopy water content. This
               difference was accentuated in two drought years, 2005 and 2010.
               This is contrary to our expectation that ADE sites would have
               nutrient‐rich soils that support trees with greener canopies and
               forests on ADE soils being more resilient to drought. Biomass
               and tree height were lower on ADE sites in comparison with
               randomly selected adjacent sites. Our results suggested that
               ADE‐related ancient human impact on the forest is measurable
               across the entirety of the 6 million km2 of Amazon Basin using
               remotely sensed data.",

               given the relative lower fertility of the majority of Amazonian
               soils in which they are embedded because of their improved
               agricultural potential and also because of their links to
               Amazonian pre-colonial history. Because of their small
               individual extent and local nature, documenting where these
               soils are located in the Amazon is a challenging task. Few
               comprehensive maps exist, and some locations are only
               approximate. In this article we present an interactive GIS in
               which we have tried to consolidate all known locations of ADEs
               to date, and to note for each location a level of accuracy and
               specificity of both the soil and its location. This is necessary
               as many older sources of locations are historical and give only
               an approximation of where they are. For more recent ADE
               citations, the geo-referenced location is given when available.

  abstract = "During the twentieth century, Amazonia was widely regarded as
              relatively pristine nature, little impacted by human history.
              This view remains popular despite mounting evidence of
              substantial human influence over millennial scales across the
              region. Here, we review the evidence of an anthropogenic Amazonia
              in response to claims of sparse populations across broad portions
              of the region. Amazonia was a major centre of crop domestication,
              with at least 83 native species containing populations
              domesticated to some degree. Plant domestication occurs in
              domesticated landscapes, including highly modified Amazonian dark
              earths (ADEs) associated with large settled populations and that
              may cover greater than 0.1\% of the region. Populations and food
              production expanded rapidly within land management systems in the
              mid-Holocene, and complex societies expanded in resource-rich
              areas creating domesticated landscapes with profound impacts on
              local and regional ecology. ADE food production projections
              support estimates of at least eight million people in 1492. By
              this time, highly diverse regional systems had developed across
              Amazonia where subsistence resources were created with plant and
              landscape domestication, including earthworks. This review argues
              that the Amazonian anthrome was no less socio-culturally diverse

               of indigenous ones, and the way hybrid vernaculars get situated

              characterised by elevated concentrations of microscopic charcoal
              particles, which confer their distinctive colouration. Frequent
              occurrences of pre-Columbian artefacts at ADE sites led to their
              ubiquitous classification as Anthrosols (soils of anthropic
              origin). However, it remains unclear how indigenous peoples
              created areas of high fertility in one of the most
              nutrient-impoverished environments on Earth. Here, we report new
              data from a well-studied ADE site in the Brazilian Amazon, which
              compel us to reconsider its anthropic origin. The amounts of
              phosphorus and calcium-two of the least abundant macronutrients
              in the region-are orders of magnitude higher in ADE profiles than
              in the surrounding soil. The elevated levels of phosphorus and
              calcium, which are often interpreted as evidence of human
              activity at other sites, correlate spatially with trace elements
              that indicate exogenous mineral sources rather than in situ
              deposition. Stable isotope ratios of neodymium, strontium, and
              radiocarbon activity of microcharcoal particles also indicate
              exogenous inputs from alluvial deposition of carbon and mineral
              elements to ADE profiles, beginning several thousands of years
              before the earliest evidence of soil management for plant
              cultivation in the region. Our data suggest that indigenous
              peoples harnessed natural processes of landscape formation, which
              led to the unique properties of ADEs, but were not responsible
              for their genesis. If corroborated elsewhere, this hypothesis
              would transform our understanding of human influence in Amazonia,

              the likelihood that terra pretas would have been formed at any
              given location in lowland Amazonia. Terra pretas were most
              frequently found in central and eastern Amazonia along the lower
              courses of the major Amazonian rivers. Terrain, hydrologic and
              soil characteristics were more important predictors of terra

               that about half the authors (30) are South Americans, and the

              biodiversity and plays a major role in the global carbon budget,
              estimates of tree biodiversity originate from fewer than 1,000
              forest inventory plots, and estimates of carbon dynamics are
              derived from fewer than 200 recensus plots. It is well documented
              that the pre-European inhabitants of Amazonia actively
              transformed and modified the forest in many regions before their
              population collapse around 1491 AD; however, the impacts of these
              ancient disturbances remain entirely unaccounted for in the many
              highly influential studies using Amazonian forest plots. Here we
              examine whether Amazonian forest inventory plot locations are
              spatially biased toward areas with high probability of ancient
              human impacts. Our analyses reveal that forest inventory plots,

              ancient human impacts. Given the long lifespan of Amazonian

              recovering from past disturbances, potentially skewing our
              interpretations of forest dynamics and our understanding of how
              these forests are responding to global change. Empirical data on

               deepened divisions among Jesuits in Brazil, but also involved

                  inequality at the receiving end. We focus on Brazil, the
                  largest receiver of African slaves and the last country to
                  abolish this institution in the Western Hemisphere, in 1888.
                  To deal with the endogeneity of slavery placement, we use a
                  spatial Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), exploiting the
                  Tordesillas Treaty, which established the colonial boundaries
                  between the Portuguese and Spanish empires within Brazil. We
                  find that the number of slaves in 1872 is discontinuously
                  higher on the Portuguese side of the border, consistent with
                  this power's comparative advantage in transatlantic slavery.
                  We then show how this differential slave rate led to higher
                  modern income inequality of 0.04 points (of the Gini Index),
                  close to 10\% of the average income inequality in the
                  country. In terms of mechanisms, we find a wider income gap,
                  and important differences in education, employment and
                  prejudice for blacks in modern times. We rule out the role of
                  colonizer identity and other mechanisms proposed in the

  abstract  = "This research examines the effects of inequality on long-run
               development within Brazil. I first exploit variation in
               temperature and precipitation to instrument for the local
               distribution of land in 1920 using a two stage least squares
               instrumental variables framework. My instrument is an index
               quantifying the suitability of local climatic conditions for
               plantation versus smallholder agriculture. I construct this
               index using information on the growing conditions of crops
               within certain plant taxonomies that are more biologically
               suited for smallholder or plantation production. I argue that
               this index more fully identifies the optimal environmental
               conditions for these two types of agricultural production, and I
               show that it serves as a robust predictor of local land
               inequality in the year 1920. IV estimates then reveal that
               greater inequality is associated with less local government
               spending on welfare and public goods over the 1995-2005 time
               period, as well as reductions in measures of local government
               quality and per-child education spending. It is also associated
               with lower levels of development, as measured by the local Human
               Development Index (HDI) for the year 2000. Inequality primarily
               affects the HDI through shorter life expectancies and lower
               incomes. I argue that the latter is consistent with the agrarian
               elite obstructing the transition of the local economy from
               agriculture to industry/services, as historically unequal
               municipalities contain a greater percentage of workers in the
               lower-wage agriculture sector, and this sector itself
               constitutes a larger share of local GDP.",

               frontier in Brazil. The settlement of large and small farmers,
               squatters, miners, and loggers in this frontier during the past
               thirty years has given rise to violent conflicts over land as
               well as environmental duress. Titles, Conflict, and Land Use
               examines the institutional development involved in the process
               of land use and ownership in the Amazon and shows how this
               phenomenon affects the behavior of the economic actors. It
               explores the way in which the absence of well-defined property
               rights in the Amazon has led to both economic and social
               problems, including lost investment opportunities, high costs in
               protecting claims, and violence. The relationship between land
               reform and violence is given special attention. The book offers
               an important application of the New Institutional Economics by
               examining a rare instance where institutional change can be
               empirically observed. This allows the authors to study property
               rights as they emerge and evolve and to analyze the effects of
               Amazon development on the economy. In doing so they illustrate
               well the point that often the evolution of economic institutions
               will not lead to efficient outcomes. This book will be important
               not only to economists but also to Latin Americanists, political

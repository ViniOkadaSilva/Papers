\section{Introduction}

Brazil is a country that historically faces issues of both land and income inequality. Estimates from USAID in 2016

However, land inequality in Brazil is something that can be found in the past.

This paper tries to answer how much of Brazil's present-day inequality can be traced to colonial institutions. Specifically, this paper uses Portuguese land grants called \textit{sesmarias}, to identify the historical persistence of colonial activity in Brazil to present-day inequality.

\textcite{Ratnoo2023-vw} [Paper about land tenure in India]


\section{Historical Background}

\textcite{Smith1944-oi} ``The only way to distribute the lands was by grants of large tracts as sesmarias''

\textcite{Dean1971-iq} - ``Anyone who claimed to have the means and desire to make use of the land was given a grant, customarily one to three leagues in extent (16.7 to 50.1 square miles).''

\textcite{Simonsen2005-ps} - ``the ones that don't possess sesmarias or can't own land are disowned by the own society they live in"

\textcite[p.~1]{De_Oliveira_Andrade1980-xz}
``The agrarian problem is one of the most serious the country has, because of the great concentration of land ownership and the low level of utilization by the large and medium property owners. A majority of the rural population receives very low wages, which practically puts them outside the consumer market''

\textcite[p.~34-35]{De_Oliveira_Andrade1980-xz} argues that 
``one of the causes that most aggravate the problem [the considerable increase in population, without a corresponding increase in possibilities for employment, is much more a swelling than an orderly growth] is the system of land tenure, dominant since colonization. It tends to contribute to the concentration of property and the lack of guarantees, of written and respected contracts, that would give greater stability to the sharecroppers in the Agreste and the Sertao and to the agricultural workers in the Zona da Mata."

\textcite[p.~36]{De_Oliveira_Andrade1980-xz}
``The concentration of landholdings in the Northeast is a consequence of the essentially commercial character of agriculture there. This character has manifested itself since the start of colonization. Even today, despite the perceptible growth of the middle class and the internal markets, it os predominant. Its control manifests itself in the protection bestowed by the government agencies on the large farms, and in the complete disdain for subsistence farming''

\textcite[p.~216]{Junior1967-jv}
``Even the law excluded cattle raising from the ten maritime  leagues which had been laid down as the area reserved for  agriculture''

\textcite[p.~113]{De_Oliveira_Andrade1980-xz}
``Extensive cattle raising, with open grazing, did not require much attention or labor. For that reason, the number of slaves in the region was small''

\textcite[p.~157]{De_Oliveira_Andrade1980-xz}
``Cattle raising is today, as in the past, the source of great wealth in the Sertao [...] The system of cattle raising on the large fazendas of the Sertao has changed little in recent years''

The first big land reform was in 1964 with the Land Act.

1985 National Agrarian Reform Plan was used.

Land grants were given until 1822, shortly before Brazil's independence.

\section{Data}

The main source of data comes from the \textit{Sesmarias of the Luso-Brazilian Empire Database}\footnote{
  Information on the content of the letters is available at \url{http://plataformasilb.cchla.ufrn.br/}. The georeferencing process was done in collaboration but as a separate project for this paper.}.
The database uses archival data from either state records or original manuscripts to obtain data on the concessions of sesmarias in Brazil. 
When available, information such as the year, the reason for the request, etc. are coded. 
The sesmarias are then georeferenced based on the geographical information present in the text, allowing us to trace them back to Brazilian municipalities.\footnote{A more in-depth description on how the sources of the letters and how the sesmarias were georeferenced is available in \autoref{app:appendix_data}}

\footnote{More information on the description based on the 1872 census data is available on \autoref{app:variable_construction_1872}}

Data for current land tenure in 2021 in Brazil is obtained from \textcite{Sparovek2019-dn}.\footnote{
  Available at \url{https://atlasagropecuario.imaflora.org/}}

Land usage from 1985-2010 is obtained from Mapbiomas\textcite{Souza2020-kb}\footnote{
  Available at \url{https://brasil.mapbiomas.org/en/}}.

Census data for 1872 is obtained from the Nucleus of Research in Economic and Geographic History from the Federal University of Minas Gerais.\footnote{
  Available at \url{http://www.nphed.cedeplar.ufmg.br/}}
The 1872 Imperial Census contains demographic data at the municipality and parish level and was the last census taken before the abolition of slavery in Brazil. \footnote{Distribution of the 1872 parishes alongside the municipality boundaries is available at \autoref{fig:parishes_1872}. For the sample used, I have 469 municipalities and 1,115 parishes.}

Other census data is obtained from the IBGE (\textit{}).\footnote{Microcensus data downloaded through the R package \textit{censobr} from \textcite{Pereira2023-qv}}

\section{Descriptive}

\subsection{Summary Statistics}

Following \textcite{Lowes2021-ww} I show balance on geographical characteristics at the 10 x 10km grid level in [reference to table here].

Summary statistics for the 1872 censuses are available in \autoref{tab:1872summary}. Overall, we can see that municipalities farther from the coast 

\subsection{OLS Descriptive}

First I show descriptively through the 1872 census that the interior of Brazil was more likely to be [...] \parencite{Laudares2022-vy}.

\begin{equation}
  Y_{p,s} = \beta_1 \cdot Morethan80km_{p,s} + \mu_s + \epsilon_{p,s}
\end{equation}

Results can be found in \autoref{tab:1872_OLS_Demographics} and \autoref{tab:1872_OLS_Labor}. Descriptively, it indicates that parishes more than 80km from the coast had a lower proportion of slaves to the total population and lower amounts of freed black people as a total of the population.

Similarly, matching to the historical evidence, these places have a higher proportion of people who report ranching as the primary occupation, and were less likely to have jobs in the industry, liberal, or other professions. 

\section{Identification Strategy}

\subsection{Coastal Ban on Livestock}

In 1701, the Portuguese Crown enacted a ban on cattle ranching from 80km of the coast (10 leagues) \parencites[p~.40]{Fausto2014-bh}[p~.198]{Simonsen2005-ps}[p~.460]{Bethell1984-of}.

\textcite{Bethell1984-of} ``Landholding in the [interior] was truly extensive. Although there was legislation limiting the size of sesmarias to three square leagues, this restriction was simply disregarded. The sesmarias on which cattle ranches were established sometimes exceeded hundreds of thousands of acres"

The effect was the expansion of cattle ranches towards the west of Brazil, especially in the Northeastern states. 
As \textcite[p~.41]{Fausto2014-bh} indicates, the need for large lands to allow cattle to roam free led to the creation of large estates in the area, even bigger than those compared to the coast.\footnote{An example of this would be the d'Avila family which owned a large estate in the state of Bahia [...]}
That led to a ``a clear specialization between the two activities'' \parencite{Ribeiro2012-lb}.\footnote{An example of the effect can be seen in the Municipality of Ruy Barbosa and the state of Bahia and Caico in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. Both are described as being created by the cattle expansion that happened because of the 1701 Royal Decree. \parencite{UnknownUnknown-ro}}

\parencite[p~.]{Boxer1962-bj}

``Cattle farming was to supply dry beef, leather, and carrying animals to the sugar mills and, later, to the villas that emerged around mining, but was not to mix itself geographically with these other two important export activities from the colonial period, nor with the coffee estates that emerged during the nineteenth century,  when  Brazil was already independent from  Portugal.'' \parencite{Ribeiro2012-lb}.

``It was there that farms measuring thousands of hectares emerged, where cattle found favourable environmental conditions for the multiplication of herds.''\parencite{Ribeiro2012-lb}.


Given the nature of this ban, I exploit the cutoff of 80 km to use a regression discontinuity design to measure the effects between the two types of economies in the region. 

In the first-stage I check whether post-1701 we see an increasing number of land grants dedicated to livestock in municipalities farther than 80 km from the coast. 

Secondly, using the 1872 I analyze whether or not there were any effects of the coastal livestock ban on the demographics and economic activities at that time.




Historically livestock-raising areas were [...]

  Y_{i,m,s} = 
\end{equation}

Provision of Public goods is the cause for the effects on literacy in 1970 and onwards (?).

“Quando o senhor não tinha uma função para o escravo, ele deixava o escravo ao ganho”, explica o historiador Diego Bissigo. “Ele ia para cidade buscar emprego e o senhor ficava com o salário que o escravo recebesse. É uma forma de uso para o escravo. Assim, ou alugando para outro senhor também.”

\label{app:variable_construction_1872}

Below are the definitions of the variables measured for the 1872 census and how they were constructed. Some of the variables are already defined in the census:

\subsection{Base Variables, available by gender and free vs. enslaved:}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Number of Literate People
  \item Number of People 6-15 Attending/Not Attending/No Information on Schooling
  \item Demographic Information on Race
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Number of Enslaved People
      \item Number of Pardos
      \item Number of Whites
      \item Number of Blacks
      \item Number of Caboclos
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Number of People not born in the state based on origin: Within Brazil or from another country.
  \item Number of people on types of jobs: Liberal/Manual/Agricultural/Industry/Other Jobs/No Jobs
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Liberal: Religious men/women, judges, lawyers, notaries, attorneys, justice officials, medics, surgeons, pharmacists, midwives, teachers, public officials, and artists.
      \item Manual or Mechanical: 
      \item Agricultural: Farmers and livestock breeders.
      \item Industry: Manufacturers and merchants.
      \item Other: Military officers, mariners, fishermen, capitalists/owners, \textit{jornaleiros} (workers that are paid based on a working day), domestic workers, and no information
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Number of people by age group.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Constructed Variables:}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Number of Free People Above the Age of 15
  $$ \sum \text{\# Of Free People Above 15} $$

  \item Literacy Rates, following \textcite{Rocha2017-yq}: 
  $$100 \times \frac{\text{\# of Literate Free People}}{\text{\# of Free People Above the Age of 15}}$$

  \item Men Literacy Rates: 
  $$100 \times \frac{\text{\# of Literate Free Men}}{\text{\# of Free Men Above the Age of 15}}$$

  \item Women Literacy Rates: 
  $$100 \times \frac{\text{\# of Literate Free Women}}{\text{\# of Free Women Above the Age of 15}} $$

  \item Total number of children between 6-15
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{l}
  \text{\# of Free People between the ages 6-15 who attend school} + \\ \text{\# of Free People between the ages 6-15 who do not attend school} + \\ \text{\# of Free People between the ages 6-15 with no information on schooling}
    \end{array}
  \end{equation*}

  \item Percentage of Children between age 6-15 who are attending school:
  \begin{equation*}
    100 \times \frac{\text{\# of Free People between the ages 6-15 who attend school}}{\text{Total \# of Free Children between 6-15}}
  \end{equation*}

  \item Percentage of Boys between age 6-15 who are attending school:
  \begin{equation*}
    100 \times \frac{\text{\# of Free Boys between the ages 6-15 who attend school}}{\text{Total \# of Free Boys between 6-15}}
  \end{equation*}

  \item Percentage of Girls between age 6-15 who are attending school:
  \begin{equation*}
    100 \times \frac{\text{\# of Free Girls between the ages 6-15 who attend school}}{\text{Total \# of Free Girls between 6-15}}
  \end{equation*}

  \item Proportion of Slaves to Free Population:
  $$ 100 \times \frac{\text{\# of Enslaved People}}{\text{\# of Free People}} $$

  \item Proportion of White/Caboclo/Black/Pardo:
  $$ 100 \times \frac{\text{\# of Free People of Certain Race}}{\text{\# of Free People}}$$

  \item Proportion of Internal/Foreign Immigrants:
  $$ 100 \times \frac{\text{\# of Free People of Certain Immigration Category}}{\text{\# of Free People}}$$
  \item Proportion of Teachers per 10,000:
  $$ 10000 \times \frac{\text{\# of Free People working as Teacher}}{\text{\# of Free People}}$$
  \item Proportion of Workers by Labor Market characteristics (as described in the data above):
  $$ 100 \times \frac{\text{\# of Total People in Certain Job}}{\text{\# of Total People}}$$
\end{enumerate}

               institutions on long run rural development using a Spatial
               Regression Discontinuity framework on a new village level data
               set from colonial India. An early 19th century historical quirk
               meant that villages in close geographical proximity were assigned
               to different property rights systems - some falling under
               landlords and others under the government. Villages that were
               assigned to landlords in the colonial era have a higher poverty
               rate and lower consumption per capita in 2012. Village census
               data from 1961 to 2011 shows that historically rooted
               characteristics in landlord villages prevented them from
               accessing Green Revolution technologies. Analysis demonstrates
               that non-landlord, cultivator villages secured preferential
               access to public investment in the early decades. Despite some
               convergence in public goods availability, lower private wealth
               and investment in landlord villages causes continuing spatial
               inequalities.",

  title    = "Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance",
  author   = "Douglass, C North and Douglass, C North",
  abstract = "Examines the role that institutions, defined as the humanly
              devised constraints that shape human interaction, play in economic
              performance and how those institutions change and how a model of
              dynamic institutions explains the differential performance of
              economies through time. Institutions are separate from
              organizations, which are assemblages of people directed to
              strategically operating within institutional constraints.
              Institutions affect the economy by influencing, together with
              technology, transaction and production costs. They do this by
              reducing uncertainty in human interaction, albeit not always
              efficiently. Entrepreneurs accomplish incremental changes in
              institutions by perceiving opportunities to do better through
              altering the institutional framework of political and economic
              organizations. Importantly, the ability to perceive these
              opportunities depends on both the completeness of information and
              the mental constructs used to process that information. Thus,
              institutions and entrepreneurs stand in a symbiotic relationship
              where each gives feedback to the other. Neoclassical economics
              suggests that inefficient institutions ought to be rapidly
              replaced. This symbiotic relationship helps explain why this
              theoretical consequence is often not observed: while this
              relationship allows growth, it also allows inefficient
              institutions to persist. The author identifies changes in relative
              prices and prevailing ideas as the source of institutional
              alterations. Transaction costs, however, may keep relative price
              changes from being fully exploited. Transaction costs are
              influenced by institutions and institutional development is
              accordingly path-dependent. (CAR)",

               controversial. These problems have recently been exacerbated by
               changes in the legal framework regulating protected areas and the
               land market. A particular challenge facing attempts to improve
               land tenure security and governance in Brazil is the lack of a
               single, integrated assessment of all types of lands. Here we
               address this problem and present a first, integrated map of
               Brazilian land tenure encompassing all official data sources
               pertaining to both public and private lands. Of the total (8.5
               million km2) 36.1\% of all lands are public (with 6.4\%
               officially undesignated), 44.2\% are private, and 16.6\% are
               unregistered or with unknown tenure. Strikingly, overlaps among
               land tenure categories sum to 50\% of the registered territory of

               important terminus of the Atlantic slave trade. Drawing on
               little-used archival sources, plantations accounts, and notarial
               records, Professor Schwartz has examined through both
               quantitative and qualitative methods the various groups that made

               lands are held in trust by the US Federal government and may not
               be used as collateral. We exploit the uniform and equal
               distribution of land between the Agua Caliente tribe and
               non-Indians in Palm Springs, CA in our analysis. Due to the
               General Allotment Act of 1887, the land was divided in a
               checkerboard pattern with even-numbered parcels provided to Agua
               Caliente government or individual tribal members and odd-numbered
               parcels (held in fee-simple status) were sold to non-Indians.
               Because of this, we overcome the usual land quality selection
               problem between the two types of property institutions. We find
               that holding local amenities and other characteristics of the
               parcel constant, there is no difference in the level of business
               investment on trust and fee simple properties. These results
               indicate that the inability to use American Indian land as
               collateral does not drive the low levels of observed business
               investment; other mechanisms and institutions may be the culprit.",

               intake of calories and proteins averaging from one-sixth to
               one-third below that of Europe or North America. While Latin
               America's agricultural exports are estimated to have increased by
               about 16 percent since the 1930s, agricultural imports, mostly
               foodstuffs, have gone up by more than 80 percent in volume, with
               serious balance-of-payments consequences in many cases.1
               Meanwhile, agrarian reform has become a major public issue,
               especially since the Cuban revolution, arousing passionate debate
               among politicians, laymen, and economists. Attitudes about the
               role of land reform differ widely. Many Latin Americans,
               including a few economists, believe land reform to be the
               solution to the agricultural production problem,, apparently
               believing that reform by itself will automatically increase
               productivity.2 On the other hand, bank missions, foreign
               ``experts,'' and economic planners usually play down the urgency
               of agrarian reform, emphasizing instead greater agricultural
               investment, improved price policy, accelerated rural-urban
               migration, and cheaper farm inputs. Although they recognize an
               agrarian problem apart from the productivity problem, many
               economists regard it",

               across countries and over time? How does the behavior of
               individual economic agents interact with the natural environment
               and general economic development to affect farm size? How has
               concerted human intervention, understood as national and
               supranational policy actions, altered these outcomes? We find
               that operated farm size rises with economic development,
               especially in the 20th century, with marked exceptions: large
               farms in Latin America and Southern Africa; small farms in parts
               of Northwest Europe; diminishing farm size in South Asia. Despite
               increased scale, in many advanced countries the family remains
               the main source of farm labor. Hired labor supervision costs tend
               to favor family farming as the equilibrium institution. Theory
               suggests that the family farm will typically become larger with
               economic development, but its efficiency advantage over the
               agroindustrial enterprise will decline. Sufficiently
               land-augmenting technical advances can upset the relationship
               between development and equilibrium scale, as in the Green
               Revolution. Concerted intervention can also cause departures from
               such equilibria. Colonial land grabs have led to inefficiently
               large farms, with market forces and land reform subsequently
               reducing average size after decolonization. Greater land rights
               have thereby raised the rural poor's income, status, and power,
               but farmland collectivizations, and much farm tenancy reform,
               have largely failed to achieve this goal. However, classic land
               reforms, and some decollectivizations, have proved more
               incentive-compatible and have distributed large land areas among
               many small family-managed units. Farm size is, in principle, also
               affected by net taxes on farm production (mostly negative in
               OECD, mostly positive in developing countries, though reduced),
               but such effects remain empirically elusive. Globalization and
               liberalization—effects via relative prices aside—have induced
               institutional changes that are not neutral with respect to farm
               size. These include supermarkets’ increased role in the supply
               chain. JEL classifications: O130, Q130, Q150",

               organization to the Americas. Their ideal was to “live like a

               distance themselves from manual labor and exercise patriarchal
               authority over a large household. Their property also allowed
               them the time and resources to be active in local politics and
               serve the Crown. They intended to reproduce in the New World the
               lifestyle of the Portuguese provincial nobility. There were,
               however, huge differences, since in Brazil the elite lorded over
               enslaved persons instead of peasants. The first elite families
               made their fortunes through the conquest and enslavement of
               Native Americans in the second half of the 16th century, but many
               of them did not manage to maintain their position during the
               transition to enslaved African labor in the following decades.
               Especially in the most dynamic areas, such as Pernambuco and
               Bahia, the first half of the 17th century was a period of flux in
               elite composition. By mid-century, however, a small number of
               families controlled most local offices, slowly fashioning
               themselves into local nobilities and wielding these claims to
               negotiate with the Crown and its representatives. Planter elites
               also established broad patron-client networks that included even
               their enslaved property. Nevertheless, their preeminence was
               threatened by the rise of merchant power in the 18th century,
               boosted by the huge demographic and economic expansion derived
               from gold discoveries in the southeast and the development of the
               internal market. Nevertheless, the noble ideal did not lose its
               appeal, and many rich merchants linked themselves to old noble
               families through marriage and the adoption of an aristocratic
               lifestyle.",

              examine the long-term impact of Mexico's 16th-century demographic
              collapse on landholding patterns through the present day. We show
              that the collapse, which reduced the indigenous population by
              between 70 and 90 percent and differed in severity across space,
              facilitated land concentration and the rise of a landowner class
              that dominated Mexican political economy for centuries. To
              identify the impact of the population collapse on land
              arrangements we use an instrumental-variables identification
              strategy exploiting climatic shocks associated with an epidemic in
              the 1570s that roughly halved the indigenous population. Though
              landholding patterns were transformed following the Revolution of
              1910, we also show that disease-impacted areas now have more land

               significance of institutional constraints, but argues that they

               of Iberian practices to the American colonies under conditions of
               imperial weakness. Colonial inequality varied across the

               performance, it mattered because it determined the extent of
               elite resistance to institutional modernisation after

               countries. We test for the importance of insecure property rights
               in Brazil on the reluctance of landowners to rent because of a
               fear of expropriation arising from land reform. Since 1964, the
               Land Statute in Brazil has targeted rental lands for
               redistribution. The expropriation of farms, resulting from land
               conflicts, is currently at the heart of land reform policies in
               Brazil. Land conflicts are a means for landless peasants to bring
               attention to land reform agencies for the need for
               redistribution. Land conflicts may also signal to landowners that
               their land is at risk for expropriation. Utilizing data across
               all counties in Brazil, we found that land conflicts reduce the
               likelihood of tenancy. This result implies: a reduction in
               agricultural efficiency; a reduction in the well-being of
               potential tenants, now landless peasants; and an expansion of the

                 information based on the timing of marriage from family
                 histories in Central China, already in the early 1500s it is
                 the case that daughters from rich families attain higher status
                 over their lifetime than daughters from poorer families. This
                 intergenerational status persistence is partly due to marital
                 sorting because daughters from high-status families tend to
                 become the wives of sons who themselves come from rich
                 families. Quantitatively, the correlation of 0.6 between the
                 status of biological and in-law families means that marriage
                 accounts for more than one third of total intergenerational
                 status transmission, while not accounting for marriage
                 overestimates mobility by more than 20 percent. Further
                 underscoring the importance of marriage, typically the status
                 of the in-law family plays a larger role for intergenerational
                 status transmission than the child's biological grandparents.
                 Over the period 1500 to 1900, the degree of marital sorting
                 falls, as does intergenerational persistence. Lower investments

               much more quickly and led to a considerably less concentrated
               ownership structure. The second essay analyzes the political
               economy of agrarian reform in Brazil. The focus is on three
               periods when serious attempts were made to carry out an agrarian
               reform; the military regime, the New Republic and the writing of
               the Constitution in 1988. In each of these attempts there was a
               perception that an agrarian reform would yield important social
               and economic benefits. However, despite the genuine intentions of
               policy makers the reforms were either blocked or reversed and had
               little effect on the concentration of land ownership. These
               events provide an interesting case study of the political economy
               of economic reform and institutional change. Additionally this
               essay uses the data from the votes of the National Constituent
               Assembly of 1988 to test both a capture model and a capture plus
               ideology model for the interests concerned with agrarian reform.
               Finally, the third essay examines the behavior of settlers on the
               Amazon frontier as concerns the use of land. This is modeled
               dynamically focusing on the security of property rights and its
               effects on the settlers' decisions. The optimal paths which
               result from the model are illustrated through a simulation.",

               illustrate the adverse effect of slavery on a broad range of
               indicators of economic development, both while slavery still
               existed and more than 30 years after its abolition. Additionally,
               I exploit the creation of communities set up to host newly
               arrived migrants from Europe to show that immigration taking
               place while slavery existed led to better developmental outcomes.
               This complements the previous finding by indicating that exiting

               resolve disputes? In this essay, I shall demonstrate the power of
               an unsettling norm: The Brazilian legal system aims neither to
               solve land conflicts justly nor to decide their legal merits
               through adjudication. My argument stresses intention and norm
               because land law in Brazil is so confusing, indecisive, and
               dysfunctional in its own terms that one suspects that the cause
               of these characteristics is not incompetence or corruption alone
               but rather the force of a set of intentions concerning its
               construction and application different from those aimed at
               resolution. Thus, I argue that Brazilian law regularly produces
               unresolvable procedural and substantive complexity in land
               conflicts; that this jural-bureaucratic irresolution dependably
               initiates extrajudicial solutions; and that these political
               impositions inevitably legalize usurpations of one sort or
               another. In short, land law in Brazil promotes conflict, not
               resolution, because it sets the terms through which encroachments
               are reliably legalized. It is thus an instrument of calculated
               disorder by means of which illegal practices produce law and
               extralegal solutions are smuggled into the judicial process. In
               this paradoxical context, law itself is a means of manipulation,
               complication, stratagem, and violence by which all parties—public
               and private, dominant and subaltern—further their interests. It
               therefore defines an arena of conflict in which distinctions
               between legal and illegal are temporary and their relations

               that it is the Iberian colonists' fault. Thus, modern analysts
               see today a more unequal Latin America compared with Asia and
               most rich post-industrial nations and assume that this must
               always have been true. Indeed, some have argued that high
               inequality appeared very early in the post-conquest Americas, and
               that this fact supported rent-seeking and anti-growth
               institutions which help explain the disappointing growth
               performance we observe there even today. The recent leveling of
               inequality in the region since the 1990s seems to have done
               little to erode that pessimism. It is important, therefore, to
               stress that this alleged persistence is based on an historical
               literature which has made little or no effort to be comparative,
               and it matters. Compared with the rest of the world, inequality
               was not high in the century following 1492, and it was not even
               high in the post-independence decades just prior to Latin
               America's belle époque and start with industrialization. It only
               became high during the commodity boom 1870?1913, by the end of
               which it had joined the rich country unequal club that included
               the USA and the UK. Latin America only became relatively high
               between 1913 and the 1970s when it missed the Great Egalitarian
               Leveling, which took place almost everywhere else. That Latin

               interested parties, but is itself a bundled and, ideally,
               coherent set of norms with legally binding status. In this
               chapter, we unbundle some facets of a labor-rental arrangement
               that has caught the attention of generations of social
               scientists, namely sharecropping contracts. We study the
               enforcement of this contract in the southwestern Brazilian
               plantations of São Paulo since the 1840s as the first experiment
               to substitute enslaved labor in ordinary agricultural tasks,
               mostly with immigrants. The adoption of crop-sharing clauses and
               their changes over time relate to the histories of the transition
               from slavery and immigration to Brazil – themes of a classical
               historiography that we revisit in this chapter. We start by
               analyzing four constituent dimensions of sharecropping as
               employed in Brazil, showing that this contract was simultaneously
               a labor arrangement, a mechanism of cost-sharing, a land-rental
               contract, and a form to bond labor with a credit interlinkage. In
               the second part of the chapter, we discuss how some of these
               features influenced labor-rental arrangements at the beginning of
               the twentieth century. We show the pervasiveness of sharecropping

                 interlinkage. The aim is to discuss why different laborrental
                 arrangements were adopted. In particular, vis-à-vis the
                 alternatives of fixed rents and wage systems, it asks why
                 sharecropping contracts were offered to European laborers
                 during the transition from slavery in Brazil. Building on some
                 new historical evidence and a formal model, the paper makes two
                 propositions about the rationale of bonded labor and
                 sharecropping. First, the credit dimension was more important
                 to landowners than specific labor-rental regimes. The credit
                 supplied by landowners allowed for the tying of immigrants via
                 indebtedness. This mechanism guaranteed a secure and stable
                 supply of labor to local agricultural elites and permitted the
                 immigration of poor and credit-constrained Europeans. This
                 prepared the insertion of Brazil into the global circuit of the
                 Age of Mass Migration without promoting institutional reforms
                 to attract non-bonded immigrants. Second, sharecropping became
                 the most prevalent contract in the first phase of the
                 transition from slavery not because of an economically rational
                 decision taken by landowners, but more as an emulation of other
                 historical and international experiences with this labor-rental

                 America, tenancy rates are low compared to the U.S. and the
                 OECD countries. We test for the importance of insecure property
                 rights in Brazil on the reluctance of landowners to rent
                 because of a fear of expropriation arising from land reform.
                 Since 1964, the Land Statute in Brazil has targeted rental
                 lands for redistribution. The expropriation of farms, resulting
                 from land conflicts, is currently at the heart of land reform
                 policies in Brazil. Land conflicts are a means for landless
                 peasants to bring attention to land reform agencies for the
                 need for redistribution. Land conflicts may also signal to
                 landowners that their land is at risk for expropriation.
                 Utilizing data across all counties in Brazil, we found that
                 land conflicts reduce the likelihood of tenancy. This result
                 implies: a reduction in agricultural efficiency; a reduction in
                 the well-being of potential tenants, now landless peasants; and
                 an expansion of the agricultural frontier through
                 deforestation. Because of endogeneity between land tenancy and

               understanding of these longstanding questions by shifting the
               emphasis from how landholding inequality fuels rural grievances
               to how it captures the collective action capacity of landowners.
               Using municipal-level data from Brazil’s large land reform
               program from 1988 to 2013, we demonstrate that the relationship
               between landholding inequality and unrest is conditional.
               Isolated threats to landed elites in the form of land invasions
               are difficult to repel, generating a positive relationship
               between landholding inequality and one-off land invasions. By
               contrast, sustained, broader local threats triggered by nearby
               land reforms catalyze landowner organization to repel land
               invasions, leading to the reverse relationship. The findings

               agrarian structure and human capital formation between and within

               agriculture is in plantation style, based on cheap coerced labor,
               or organized around family farming matters for the formulation of
               educational policies. According to the main claim, landlords were
               not interested in paying higher taxes to educate the masses and
               curtailed the expansion of schooling in order to keep a cheap
               workforce and maintain their monopoly over the decision-making
               process. Describing several episodes in Brazil’s history of
               public instruction, the paper stresses the distributional
               conflicts over education as well as the rural aristocracy’s
               resistance towards broadly-targeted, citizenship-enhancing
               educational policies. The descriptive evidence is complemented by
               statistical analyses employing historical as well as more recent
               data. It is shown that states characterized by a more egalitarian
               land distribution, which are not under the dominance of powerful
               landlords, exhibit better educational coverage and enhanced
               instruction quality. They also spend more on schooling.",

              transition across African societies, and how do these differences
              affect economic development? We address this question by analyzing
              the average and heterogeneous effects of colonial-era Christian
              missionary activity on human capital accumulation, fertility, and
              wealth in Nigeria. Our identification strategy exploits
              discontinuities in mission stations around the borders of some
              Emirates of Northern Nigeria where missions were restricted from
              operating by the colonial administration. We find that areas with
              greater historical missionary activity have higher levels of
              schooling, lower fertility, and higher household wealth today. The
              long-run effect of missions is not found in areas with early
              access to government schools, and is larger for population
              subgroups—women and Muslims—that have historically suffered
              disadvantages in access to education. Importantly, we show that
              the restriction of missions in some Emirates of Northern Nigeria
              has led to a reversal of fortunes, wherein areas that were more
              institutionally developed in the precolonial period are relatively
              poorer today as a result of a slower pace of the demographic
              transition. The findings support the predictions of the unified
              theory of economic growth, whereby technological advancement leads
              to greater demand for education, triggering a fertility decline

  abstract      = "Omitted variables are a common concern in empirical research.
                   We distinguish between two ways omitted variables can affect
                   baseline estimates: by driving them to zero or by reversing
                   their sign. We show that, depending on how the impact of
                   omitted variables is measured, it can be substantially easier
                   for omitted variables to flip coefficient signs than to drive
                   them to zero. Consequently, results which are considered
                   robust to being ``explained away'' by omitted variables are
                   not necessarily robust to sign changes. We show that this
                   behavior occurs with ``Oster's delta'' (Oster 2019), a
                   commonly reported measure of regression coefficient
                   robustness to the presence of omitted variables.
                   Specifically, we show that any time this measure is
                   large--suggesting that omitted variables may be
                   unimportant--a much smaller value reverses the sign of the
                   parameter of interest. Relatedly, we show that selection bias
                   adjusted estimands can be extremely sensitive to the choice
                   of the sensitivity parameter. Specifically, researchers
                   commonly compute a bias adjustment under the assumption that
                   Oster's delta equals one. Under the alternative assumption
                   that delta is very close to one, but not exactly equal to
                   one, we show that the bias can instead be arbitrarily large.
                   To address these concerns, we propose a modified measure of
                   robustness that accounts for such sign changes, and discuss
                   best practices for assessing sensitivity to omitted
                   variables. We demonstrate this sign flipping behavior in an
                   empirical application to social capital and the rise of the
                   Nazi party, where we show how it can overturn conclusions
                   about robustness, and how our proposed modifications can be
                   used to regain robustness. We analyze three additional
                   empirical applications as well. We implement our proposed
                   methods in the companion Stata module regsensitivity for easy
                   use in practice.",

  abstract  = "The Portuguese economy, since the end of the Iberian Union,
               entered a crisis. To try to solve the economic problems, numerous
               expeditions were promoted to the interior of Brazil in search of
               natural and mineral wealth. Within this exploratory logic, the
               occupation of Minas Gerais was established as of the end of the
               17th century. From that moment on, people from all regions of the
               empire gradually occupied the Generals in search of gold, other
               economic activities and rapid enrichment. To control this
               exploration and territorial expansion, the Crown adopts the
               Portuguese Crown land concessions, which consisted of the
               donation of a land improvement to those willing to colonize the
               territory and make it productive in some way. From this
               perspective, this thesis aims to investigate the formation of the
               Minas Gerais space from this kind of land concession. For this, a
               thorough analysis of the Inventário das Cartas de Sesmarias was
               made available in the Arquivo Público Mineiro, this inventory,
               which contains the description of all the Portguese Crwon land
               concession that were distributed in Minas Gerais. With the
               creation of a database made from the transcription of this
               inventory, it was possible to establish dialogues with the
               History of Minas, comprising each economic moment throughout the
               18th and early 19th centuries, relating them to the spatial
               occupation of the Captaincy. Through the techniques of
               georeferencing and Space History, it was possible to establish
               important aspects of the relationship between History and
               Geography, as well as the understanding of formation and spatial
               transformation. Finally, the Sesmariasl system was analyzed,
               evaluating its distribution over periods, by type of donations,
               the titles of sesmeiros, in order to understand how this system
               relates to the economic and social formation of Minas Gerais and
               trying to understand what shape the space is formed from the
               socioeconomic needs of each region. From these analyzes, it was
               concluded that the space of Minas Gerais followed the movements
               of economic activities in each region over time, realizing the
               expansion of the frontiers of mining occupation and the
               retraction of the frontiers of the hinterland, from the
               understanding that these they are not static and are constantly

               However, there is still a gap of annual land use and land cover
               (LULC) information in all Brazilian biomes in the country.
               Existing countrywide efforts to map land use and land cover lack
               regularly updates and high spatial resolution time-series data to
               better understand historical land use and land cover dynamics,

               we described a novel approach and the results achieved by a
               multi-disciplinary network called MapBiomas to reconstruct annual
               land use and land cover information between 1985 and 2017 for
               Brazil, based on random forest applied to Landsat archive using
               Google Earth Engine. We mapped five major classes: forest,
               non-forest natural formation, farming, non-vegetated areas, and
               water. These classes were broken into two sub-classification
               levels leading to the most comprehensive and detailed mapping for
               the country at a 30 m pixel resolution. The average overall
               accuracy of the land use and land cover time-series, based on a
               stratified random sample of 75,000 pixel locations, was 89\%
               ranging from 73 to 95\% in the biomes. The 33 years of LULC
               change data series revealed that Brazil lost 71 Mha of natural
               vegetation, mostly to cattle ranching and agriculture activities.
               Pasture expanded by 46\% from 1985 to 2017, and agriculture by
               172\%, mostly replacing old pasture fields. We also identified
               that 86 Mha of the converted native vegetation was undergoing
               some level of regrowth. Several applications of the MapBiomas
               dataset are underway, suggesting that reconstructing historical
               land use and land cover change maps is useful for advancing the

               focuses on the historic interaction between ruggedness and
               Africa's slave trades. Although rugged terrain hinders trade and
               most productive activities, negatively affecting income globally,
               rugged terrain within Africa afforded protection to those being
               raided during the slave trades. Since the slave trades retarded
               subsequent economic development, ruggedness within Africa has
               also had a historic indirect positive effect on income. Studying
               all countries worldwide, we estimate the differential effect of
               ruggedness on income for Africa. We show that the differential
               effect of ruggedness is statistically significant and
               economically meaningful, it is found in Africa only, it cannot be
               explained by other factors like Africa's unique geographic
               environment, and it is fully accounted for by the history of the

               like the four ‘legs’ that sustain this immense bovine, to enable
               its adaptation to Brazilian lands. These four factors, before

               the agrarian question and the dominance of the large latifundio
               estates as the key to explaining their countries’
               underdevelopment. Yet, in more recent years, the emphasis on
               agrarian structures has declined and the latifundio is no longer
               seen as a relevant factor to economic development. In its place
               have emerged explanations that emphasize international trade

               study makes a case for bringing the latifundio “back in” to
               explanations of underdevelopment in Latin America, and points to
               the persistence of particular property relations, low-intensity

               the deepening of industrialization. Resumen Intelectuales
               latinoamericanos en el siglo veinte frecuentemente senalaban a la
               cuestion agraria y la dominacion latifundiaria como la clave para
               explicar el subdesarrollo de sus paises. Sin embargo, en anos

               latifundio ya no es visto como un factor relevante para el

                  largest receiver of African slaves and the last country to
                  abolish this institution in the Western Hemisphere, in 1888.
                  To deal with the endogeneity of slavery placement, we use a
                  spatial Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), exploiting the
                  Tordesillas Treaty, which established the colonial boundaries
                  between the Portuguese and Spanish empires within Brazil. We
                  find that the number of slaves in 1872 is discontinuously
                  higher on the Portuguese side of the border, consistent with
                  this power's comparative advantage in transatlantic slavery.
                  We then show how this differential slave rate led to higher
                  modern income inequality of 0.04 points (of the Gini Index),
                  close to 10\% of the average income inequality in the country.

  abstract  = "Downloadable! Brazil is frequently portrayed as exhibiting
               persistent and structural economic inequality that is rooted in
               the early colonial experience, and is believed to undermine
               development in the long run. I construct original measures of
               agricultural inequality for 1905 in what is today Brazil’s
               largest state, using farm-level micro data for some 50,000 farms.
               Using these measures of inequality, along with contemporary
               covariates and other historical variables I assess the impact of
               colonial institutions, slavery, farm inequality, and political
               inequality on long-term development in São Paulo. The principal
               findings are: (1) a potentially coercive colonial institution,
               the aldeamento, is positively correlated with income per capita
               at the end of the twentieth century; (2) measures of the
               intensity of slavery have little if any independent impact on
               income in 2000; (3) farm inequality was not persistent in São
               Paulo at the county level over the twentieth century; (4) in both
               OLS and IV estimates, no negative effect can be found for 1905
               inequality on long-term development; (5) political inequality in
               the early twentieth century, measured by the extent of the
               franchise, is unrelated to contemporary farm inequality, and also
               unrelated to long-term economic growth; and (6) the provision of
               local public goods in the early twentieth century, measured by
               local public education outlays, has a positive impact on
               long-term development, but was not related to contemporary
               economic or political inequality. Overall, neither the intensity
               of slavery nor the pattern of inequality had any discernable
               negative economic impact in the long run.",

               distribution of land in 1920 using a two stage least squares
               instrumental variables framework. My instrument is an index
               quantifying the suitability of local climatic conditions for
               plantation versus smallholder agriculture. I construct this index
               using information on the growing conditions of crops within
               certain plant taxonomies that are more biologically suited for
               smallholder or plantation production. I argue that this index
               more fully identifies the optimal environmental conditions for
               these two types of agricultural production, and I show that it
               serves as a robust predictor of local land inequality in the year
               1920. IV estimates then reveal that greater inequality is
               associated with less local government spending on welfare and
               public goods over the 1995-2005 time period, as well as
               reductions in measures of local government quality and per-child

               through shorter life expectancies and lower incomes. I argue that
               the latter is consistent with the agrarian elite obstructing the
               transition of the local economy from agriculture to
               industry/services, as historically unequal municipalities contain

               in Brazil. The settlement of large and small farmers, squatters,
               miners, and loggers in this frontier during the past thirty years
               has given rise to violent conflicts over land as well as
               environmental duress. Titles, Conflict, and Land Use examines the
               institutional development involved in the process of land use and
               ownership in the Amazon and shows how this phenomenon affects the
               behavior of the economic actors. It explores the way in which the
               absence of well-defined property rights in the Amazon has led to
               both economic and social problems, including lost investment
               opportunities, high costs in protecting claims, and violence. The
               relationship between land reform and violence is given special
               attention. The book offers an important application of the New
               Institutional Economics by examining a rare instance where
               institutional change can be empirically observed. This allows the
               authors to study property rights as they emerge and evolve and to
               analyze the effects of Amazon development on the economy. In
               doing so they illustrate well the point that often the evolution
               of economic institutions will not lead to efficient outcomes.
               This book will be important not only to economists but also to

               tip of Africa. After its founding in 1652 as a provisioning
               outpost for ships of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), the
               colonial government promoted settlement initially by granting
               land with well‐specified and enforced property rights in
               restricted zones near Cape Town. By 1714 it transitioned to
               accommodate rapidly expanding settlement by creating a weaker
               form of property rights, the loan farm, which was imprecisely
               defined and had limited government enforcement. We develop a
               profit‐maximizing monopsony model to explain the VOC's choice to
               transition from the better‐specified land grant to the less
               well‐specified loan farm. We conclude that the decline in the
               population size and ability of the Khoikhoi, the Cape's original
               inhabitants, to organize effective resistance to the Dutch
               invasion was critical to the transition, as it lowered the costs
               of private enforcement of settlers’ territorial claims. The
               choice of property rights thus enabled and encouraged the rapid
               taking by European settlers of the western Cape of Africa for the
               expansion of the Dutch colony's pastoral economy.",

               grievances sometimes exacerbate unrest? We advance the
               understanding of these longstanding questions by shifting the
               emphasis from how landholding inequality fuels rural grievances
               to how it captures the collective action capacity of landowners.
               Using municipal-level data from Brazil?s large land reform
               program from 1988 to 2013, we demonstrate that the relationship
               between landholding inequality and unrest is conditional.
               Isolated threats to landed elites in the form of land invasions
               are difficult to repel, generating a positive relationship
               between landholding inequality and one-off land invasions. By

               land reforms catalyze landowner organization to repel land
               invasions, leading to the reverse relationship. The findings

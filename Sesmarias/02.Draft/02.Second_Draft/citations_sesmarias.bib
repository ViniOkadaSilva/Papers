                  institutions on long run rural development using a Spatial
                  Regression Discontinuity framework on a new village level data
                  set from colonial India. An early 19th century historical
                  quirk meant that villages in close geographical proximity were
                  assigned to different property rights systems - some falling
                  under landlords and others under the government. Villages that
                  were assigned to landlords in the colonial era have a higher
                  poverty rate and lower consumption per capita in 2012. Village
                  census data from 1961 to 2011 shows that historically rooted
                  characteristics in landlord villages prevented them from
                  accessing Green Revolution technologies. Analysis demonstrates
                  that non-landlord, cultivator villages secured preferential
                  access to public investment in the early decades. Despite some
                  convergence in public goods availability, lower private wealth
                  and investment in landlord villages causes continuing spatial
                  inequalities.},

  title    = {Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance},
  author   = {Douglass, C North and Douglass, C North},
  date     = {1990},
  abstract = {Examines the role that institutions, defined as the humanly
              devised constraints that shape human interaction, play in economic
              performance and how those institutions change and how a model of
              dynamic institutions explains the differential performance of
              economies through time. Institutions are separate from
              organizations, which are assemblages of people directed to
              strategically operating within institutional constraints.
              Institutions affect the economy by influencing, together with
              technology, transaction and production costs. They do this by
              reducing uncertainty in human interaction, albeit not always
              efficiently. Entrepreneurs accomplish incremental changes in
              institutions by perceiving opportunities to do better through
              altering the institutional framework of political and economic
              organizations. Importantly, the ability to perceive these
              opportunities depends on both the completeness of information and
              the mental constructs used to process that information. Thus,
              institutions and entrepreneurs stand in a symbiotic relationship
              where each gives feedback to the other. Neoclassical economics
              suggests that inefficient institutions ought to be rapidly
              replaced. This symbiotic relationship helps explain why this
              theoretical consequence is often not observed: while this
              relationship allows growth, it also allows inefficient
              institutions to persist. The author identifies changes in relative
              prices and prevailing ideas as the source of institutional
              alterations. Transaction costs, however, may keep relative price
              changes from being fully exploited. Transaction costs are
              influenced by institutions and institutional development is
              accordingly path-dependent. (CAR)}

                  long-run development, using Vietnam as a laboratory. Northern
                  Vietnam (Dai Viet) was ruled by a strong centralized state in
                  which the village was the fundamental administrative unit.
                  Southern Vietnam was a peripheral tributary of the Khmer
                  (Cambodian) Empire, which followed a patron-client model with
                  weaker, more personalized power relations and no village
                  intermediation. Using a regression discontinuity design across
                  the Dai Viet-Khmer boundary, the study shows that areas
                  historically under a strong state have higher living standards
                  today and better economic outcomes over the past 150 years.
                  Rich historical data document that in villages with a strong

               quantitative and qualitative methods the various groups that made

               sugar-making and the nature of plantation labour are used

                  Indian lands are held in trust by the US Federal government
                  and may not be used as collateral. We exploit the uniform and
                  equal distribution of land between the Agua Caliente tribe and
                  non-Indians in Palm Springs, CA in our analysis. Due to the
                  General Allotment Act of 1887, the land was divided in a
                  checkerboard pattern with even-numbered parcels provided to
                  Agua Caliente government or individual tribal members and
                  odd-numbered parcels (held in fee-simple status) were sold to
                  non-Indians. Because of this, we overcome the usual land
                  quality selection problem between the two types of property
                  institutions. We find that holding local amenities and other
                  characteristics of the parcel constant, there is no difference
                  in the level of business investment on trust and fee simple
                  properties. These results indicate that the inability to use
                  American Indian land as collateral does not drive the low
                  levels of observed business investment; other mechanisms and

                  some 10 percent below its pre-World War II level for the past
                  two decades. Mexico is the only notable exception to this
                  general picture of relative stagnation. Malnutrition is
                  widespread, with intake of calories and proteins averaging
                  from one-sixth to one-third below that of Europe or North
                  America. While Latin America's agricultural exports are
                  estimated to have increased by about 16 percent since the
                  1930s, agricultural imports, mostly foodstuffs, have gone up
                  by more than 80 percent in volume, with serious
                  balance-of-payments consequences in many cases.1 Meanwhile,
                  agrarian reform has become a major public issue, especially
                  since the Cuban revolution, arousing passionate debate among
                  politicians, laymen, and economists. Attitudes about the role
                  of land reform differ widely. Many Latin Americans, including
                  a few economists, believe land reform to be the solution to
                  the agricultural production problem,, apparently believing
                  that reform by itself will automatically increase
                  productivity.2 On the other hand, bank missions, foreign
                  "experts," and economic planners usually play down the urgency
                  of agrarian reform, emphasizing instead greater agricultural
                  investment, improved price policy, accelerated rural-urban
                  migration, and cheaper farm inputs. Although they recognize an
                  agrarian problem apart from the productivity problem, many
                  economists regard it}

               across countries and over time? How does the behavior of
               individual economic agents interact with the natural environment
               and general economic development to affect farm size? How has
               concerted human intervention, understood as national and
               supranational policy actions, altered these outcomes? We find
               that operated farm size rises with economic development,
               especially in the 20th century, with marked exceptions: large
               farms in Latin America and Southern Africa; small farms in parts
               of Northwest Europe; diminishing farm size in South Asia. Despite
               increased scale, in many advanced countries the family remains
               the main source of farm labor. Hired labor supervision costs tend
               to favor family farming as the equilibrium institution. Theory
               suggests that the family farm will typically become larger with
               economic development, but its efficiency advantage over the
               agroindustrial enterprise will decline. Sufficiently
               land-augmenting technical advances can upset the relationship
               between development and equilibrium scale, as in the Green
               Revolution. Concerted intervention can also cause departures from
               such equilibria. Colonial land grabs have led to inefficiently
               large farms, with market forces and land reform subsequently
               reducing average size after decolonization. Greater land rights
               have thereby raised the rural poor's income, status, and power,
               but farmland collectivizations, and much farm tenancy reform,
               have largely failed to achieve this goal. However, classic land
               reforms, and some decollectivizations, have proved more
               incentive-compatible and have distributed large land areas among
               many small family-managed units. Farm size is, in principle, also
               affected by net taxes on farm production (mostly negative in
               OECD, mostly positive in developing countries, though reduced),
               but such effects remain empirically elusive. Globalization and
               liberalization—effects via relative prices aside—have induced
               institutional changes that are not neutral with respect to farm
               size. These include supermarkets’ increased role in the supply
               chain. JEL classifications: O130, Q130, Q150},

  abstract     = {Land tenure in many parts of Brazil remains uncertain and
                  controversial. These problems have recently been exacerbated
                  by changes in the legal framework regulating protected areas
                  and the land market. A particular challenge facing attempts to
                  improve land tenure security and governance in Brazil is the
                  lack of a single, integrated assessment of all types of lands.
                  Here we address this problem and present a first, integrated
                  map of Brazilian land tenure encompassing all official data
                  sources pertaining to both public and private lands. Of the
                  total (8.5 million km2) 36.1\% of all lands are public (with
                  6.4\% officially undesignated), 44.2\% are private, and 16.6\%
                  are unregistered or with unknown tenure. Strikingly, overlaps
                  among land tenure categories sum to 50\% of the registered
                  territory of Brazil. A clearer understanding of uncertainties
                  in land tenure, and the spatial distribution of those
                  uncertainties can help guide research and public policies
                  focused on minimizing land conflicts and strengthening
                  governance and territorial planning to improve economic,
                  environmental and social outcomes from land use in Brazil.},

               organization to the Americas. Their ideal was to “live like a
               gentleman,” that is, to own land and command laborers in order to
               distance themselves from manual labor and exercise patriarchal
               authority over a large household. Their property also allowed
               them the time and resources to be active in local politics and
               serve the Crown. They intended to reproduce in the New World the
               lifestyle of the Portuguese provincial nobility. There were,
               however, huge differences, since in Brazil the elite lorded over
               enslaved persons instead of peasants. The first elite families
               made their fortunes through the conquest and enslavement of
               Native Americans in the second half of the 16th century, but many
               of them did not manage to maintain their position during the
               transition to enslaved African labor in the following decades.
               Especially in the most dynamic areas, such as Pernambuco and
               Bahia, the first half of the 17th century was a period of flux in
               elite composition. By mid-century, however, a small number of
               families controlled most local offices, slowly fashioning
               themselves into local nobilities and wielding these claims to
               negotiate with the Crown and its representatives. Planter elites
               also established broad patron-client networks that included even
               their enslaved property. Nevertheless, their preeminence was
               threatened by the rise of merchant power in the 18th century,
               boosted by the huge demographic and economic expansion derived
               from gold discoveries in the southeast and the development of the
               internal market. Nevertheless, the noble ideal did not lose its
               appeal, and many rich merchants linked themselves to old noble
               families through marriage and the adoption of an aristocratic
               lifestyle.},

                  demographic collapse on landholding patterns through the
                  present day. We show that the collapse, which reduced the
                  indigenous population by between 70 and 90 percent and
                  differed in severity across space, facilitated land
                  concentration and the rise of a landowner class that dominated
                  Mexican political economy for centuries. To identify the
                  impact of the population collapse on land arrangements we use
                  an instrumental-variables identification strategy exploiting
                  climatic shocks associated with an epidemic in the 1570s that
                  roughly halved the indigenous population. Though landholding
                  patterns were transformed following the Revolution of 1910, we
                  also show that disease-impacted areas now have more land in
                  common-property institutions with limited property rights. The
                  population collapse thus had a persistent impact on Mexican
                  political economy, but the nature of this impact has changed

                  underdevelopment in defective colonial institutions linked to
                  inequality. The contrasting view offered here affirms the
                  significance of institutional constraints, but argues that
                  they did not arise from colonial inequalities, but from the
                  adaptation of Iberian practices to the American colonies under
                  conditions of imperial weakness. Colonial inequality varied
                  across the Americas; while it was not correlated with colonial
                  economic performance, it mattered because it determined the
                  extent of elite resistance to institutional modernisation
                  after independence. The onset of economic growth in the mid to
                  late nineteenth century brought economic elites to political
                  power, but excluding majorities as inequality increased
                  restrained the region's twentieth-century growth rates and

               so-called plantationist perspective have rejected the classic
               view that large estates shaped colonial and nineteenth century
               Brazilian economy and society, arguing instead for a major role
               of small and medium-sized landholdings. We describe the size
               distribution of landholdings and estimate alternative measures of
               land concentration based on a detailed agricultural census of the
               state of São Paulo. We find that, despite variation across
               municipalities, large farms and latifundia controlled most of the
               productive resources in northeast São Paulo, resulting in high
               levels of inequality when compared to those of other agrarian
               societies in the past. These results contrast with the view of
               the critics of classic historiography and suggest that the large
               estate and high concentration of wealth were remarkable features
               at least in the most important coffee region in Brazil during the

               America, tenancy rates are low compared to the U.S. and the OECD
               countries. We test for the importance of insecure property rights
               in Brazil on the reluctance of landowners to rent because of a
               fear of expropriation arising from land reform. Since 1964, the
               Land Statute in Brazil has targeted rental lands for
               redistribution. The expropriation of farms, resulting from land
               conflicts, is currently at the heart of land reform policies in
               Brazil. Land conflicts are a means for landless peasants to bring
               attention to land reform agencies for the need for
               redistribution. Land conflicts may also signal to landowners that
               their land is at risk for expropriation. Utilizing data across
               all counties in Brazil, we found that land conflicts reduce the
               likelihood of tenancy. This result implies: a reduction in
               agricultural efficiency; a reduction in the well-being of
               potential tenants, now landless peasants; and an expansion of the
               agricultural frontier through deforestation. Because of
               endogeneity between land tenancy and land conflict we instrument
               land conflict with Catholic priests.},

                 mobility during the Ming-Qing (1368-1911) period. Using status
                 information based on the timing of marriage from family
                 histories in Central China, already in the early 1500s it is
                 the case that daughters from rich families attain higher status
                 over their lifetime than daughters from poorer families. This
                 intergenerational status persistence is partly due to marital
                 sorting because daughters from high-status families tend to
                 become the wives of sons who themselves come from rich
                 families. Quantitatively, the correlation of 0.6 between the
                 status of biological and in-law families means that marriage
                 accounts for more than one third of total intergenerational
                 status transmission, while not accounting for marriage
                 overestimates mobility by more than 20 percent. Further
                 underscoring the importance of marriage, typically the status
                 of the in-law family plays a larger role for intergenerational
                 status transmission than the child's biological grandparents.
                 Over the period 1500 to 1900, the degree of marital sorting
                 falls, as does intergenerational persistence. Lower investments
                 in the marriage market to find a good match for a daughter go
                 hand in hand with the fall in the returns to son education due
                 to the decline of China's civil service examination.},

  abstract    = {Land in Brazil is the common theme that binds together the
                 three essays that compose this dissertation. The first essay
                 examines the economic history of land policy in Brazil, from
                 early colonial policy to the tardy formation of a market for
                 land by the end of the nineteenth century. This is done by
                 comparing the development of the Brazilian land policy with the
                 path that was followed in the United States, where a market for
                 land evolved much more quickly and led to a considerably less
                 concentrated ownership structure. The second essay analyzes the
                 political economy of agrarian reform in Brazil. The focus is on
                 three periods when serious attempts were made to carry out an
                 agrarian reform; the military regime, the New Republic and the
                 writing of the Constitution in 1988. In each of these attempts
                 there was a perception that an agrarian reform would yield
                 important social and economic benefits. However, despite the
                 genuine intentions of policy makers the reforms were either
                 blocked or reversed and had little effect on the concentration
                 of land ownership. These events provide an interesting case
                 study of the political economy of economic reform and
                 institutional change. Additionally this essay uses the data
                 from the votes of the National Constituent Assembly of 1988 to
                 test both a capture model and a capture plus ideology model for
                 the interests concerned with agrarian reform. Finally, the
                 third essay examines the behavior of settlers on the Amazon
                 frontier as concerns the use of land. This is modeled
                 dynamically focusing on the security of property rights and its
                 effects on the settlers' decisions. The optimal paths which
                 result from the model are illustrated through a simulation.},

                  proporcionam maior rentabilidade por área e a criação de gado
                  bovino tem se deslocado para as zonas de expansão da fronteira
                  agrícola, notadamente nos estados amazônicos. O Brasil é um
                  grande produtor e exportador de carne bovina, permanecendo na
                  primeira posição no ranking mundial na produção para fins
                  comerciais, pelo fato da Índia, que possui o maior efetivo
                  bovino não utilizar totalmente o seu rebanho para fins
                  econômicos. Esse texto tem o objetivo de analisar,
                  sucintamente, a evolução e a espacialização da bovinocultura
                  no Brasil, com ênfase no Centro-Oeste do país.},

               slave trade. Yet, the lack of disaggregated data able to capture
               the intensity of slavery across time and space means that
               researchers have struggled to identify the economic impact of the
               institution. I propose to measure slavery using the presence of
               communities descended from those founded by runaway slaves: the
               Quilombos. Combining this measure with municipal level data, I
               illustrate the adverse effect of slavery on a broad range of
               indicators of economic development, both while slavery still
               existed and more than 30 years after its abolition. Additionally,
               I exploit the creation of communities set up to host newly
               arrived migrants from Europe to show that immigration taking
               place while slavery existed led to better developmental outcomes.
               This complements the previous finding by indicating that exiting
               a slavery-based economy earlier thanks to an influx of free
               workers was beneficial for development. JEL: J15, N36, O12, O43},

                  conflict, if it is a means to perpetuate and obscure rather
                  than resolve disputes? In this essay, I shall demonstrate the
                  power of an unsettling norm: The Brazilian legal system aims
                  neither to solve land conflicts justly nor to decide their
                  legal merits through adjudication. My argument stresses
                  intention and norm because land law in Brazil is so confusing,
                  indecisive, and dysfunctional in its own terms that one
                  suspects that the cause of these characteristics is not
                  incompetence or corruption alone but rather the force of a set
                  of intentions concerning its construction and application
                  different from those aimed at resolution. Thus, I argue that
                  Brazilian law regularly produces unresolvable procedural and
                  substantive complexity in land conflicts; that this
                  jural-bureaucratic irresolution dependably initiates
                  extrajudicial solutions; and that these political impositions
                  inevitably legalize usurpations of one sort or another. In
                  short, land law in Brazil promotes conflict, not resolution,
                  because it sets the terms through which encroachments are
                  reliably legalized. It is thus an instrument of calculated
                  disorder by means of which illegal practices produce law and
                  extralegal solutions are smuggled into the judicial process.
                  In this paradoxical context, law itself is a means of
                  manipulation, complication, stratagem, and violence by which
                  all parties—public and private, dominant and subaltern—further
                  their interests. It therefore defines an arena of conflict in
                  which distinctions between legal and illegal are temporary and
                  their relations unstable.},

                  the pessimistic belief in historical persistence?they believe
                  that Latin America has always had very high levels of
                  inequality, and that it is the Iberian colonists' fault. Thus,
                  modern analysts see today a more unequal Latin America
                  compared with Asia and most rich post-industrial nations and
                  assume that this must always have been true. Indeed, some have
                  argued that high inequality appeared very early in the
                  post-conquest Americas, and that this fact supported
                  rent-seeking and anti-growth institutions which help explain
                  the disappointing growth performance we observe there even
                  today. The recent leveling of inequality in the region since
                  the 1990s seems to have done little to erode that pessimism.
                  It is important, therefore, to stress that this alleged
                  persistence is based on an historical literature which has
                  made little or no effort to be comparative, and it matters.
                  Compared with the rest of the world, inequality was not high
                  in the century following 1492, and it was not even high in the
                  post-independence decades just prior to Latin America's belle
                  époque and start with industrialization. It only became high
                  during the commodity boom 1870?1913, by the end of which it
                  had joined the rich country unequal club that included the USA
                  and the UK. Latin America only became relatively high between
                  1913 and the 1970s when it missed the Great Egalitarian
                  Leveling, which took place almost everywhere else. That Latin
                  American inequality has its roots in its colonial past is a
                  myth.}

               of drawing together; a contract brings together not only the
               interested parties, but is itself a bundled and, ideally,
               coherent set of norms with legally binding status. In this
               chapter, we unbundle some facets of a labor-rental arrangement
               that has caught the attention of generations of social
               scientists, namely sharecropping contracts. We study the
               enforcement of this contract in the southwestern Brazilian
               plantations of São Paulo since the 1840s as the first experiment
               to substitute enslaved labor in ordinary agricultural tasks,
               mostly with immigrants. The adoption of crop-sharing clauses and
               their changes over time relate to the histories of the transition
               from slavery and immigration to Brazil – themes of a classical
               historiography that we revisit in this chapter. We start by
               analyzing four constituent dimensions of sharecropping as
               employed in Brazil, showing that this contract was simultaneously
               a labor arrangement, a mechanism of cost-sharing, a land-rental
               contract, and a form to bond labor with a credit interlinkage. In
               the second part of the chapter, we discuss how some of these
               features influenced labor-rental arrangements at the beginning of
               the twentieth century. We show the pervasiveness of sharecropping
               as a contract per se, as well as the influences that those four
               dimensions had on new labor-rental arrangements.},

                 contracts to bond immigrant households with a credit-labor
                 interlinkage. The aim is to discuss why different laborrental
                 arrangements were adopted. In particular, vis-à-vis the
                 alternatives of fixed rents and wage systems, it asks why
                 sharecropping contracts were offered to European laborers
                 during the transition from slavery in Brazil. Building on some
                 new historical evidence and a formal model, the paper makes two
                 propositions about the rationale of bonded labor and
                 sharecropping. First, the credit dimension was more important
                 to landowners than specific labor-rental regimes. The credit
                 supplied by landowners allowed for the tying of immigrants via
                 indebtedness. This mechanism guaranteed a secure and stable
                 supply of labor to local agricultural elites and permitted the
                 immigration of poor and credit-constrained Europeans. This
                 prepared the insertion of Brazil into the global circuit of the
                 Age of Mass Migration without promoting institutional reforms
                 to attract non-bonded immigrants. Second, sharecropping became
                 the most prevalent contract in the first phase of the
                 transition from slavery not because of an economically rational
                 decision taken by landowners, but more as an emulation of other
                 historical and international experiences with this labor-rental
                 arrangement.},

                  the OECD countries. We test for the importance of insecure
                  property rights in Brazil on the reluctance of landowners to
                  rent because of a fear of expropriation arising from land
                  reform. Since 1964, the Land Statute in Brazil has targeted
                  rental lands for redistribution. The expropriation of farms,
                  resulting from land conflicts, is currently at the heart of
                  land reform policies in Brazil. Land conflicts are a means for
                  landless peasants to bring attention to land reform agencies
                  for the need for redistribution. Land conflicts may also
                  signal to landowners that their land is at risk for
                  expropriation. Utilizing data across all counties in Brazil,
                  we found that land conflicts reduce the likelihood of tenancy.
                  This result implies: a reduction in agricultural efficiency; a
                  reduction in the well-being of potential tenants, now landless
                  peasants; and an expansion of the agricultural frontier
                  through deforestation. Because of endogeneity between land
                  tenancy and land conflict we instrument land conflict with
                  Catholic priests.},

                  advance the understanding of these longstanding questions by
                  shifting the emphasis from how landholding inequality fuels
                  rural grievances to how it captures the collective action
                  capacity of landowners. Using municipal-level data from
                  Brazil’s large land reform program from 1988 to 2013, we
                  demonstrate that the relationship between landholding
                  inequality and unrest is conditional. Isolated threats to
                  landed elites in the form of land invasions are difficult to
                  repel, generating a positive relationship between landholding
                  inequality and one-off land invasions. By contrast, sustained,
                  broader local threats triggered by nearby land reforms
                  catalyze landowner organization to repel land invasions,
                  leading to the reverse relationship. The findings provide a
                  novel answer for why a straightforward link between land
                  inequality and rural unrest is elusive and may generalize to a

                  agrarian structure and human capital formation between and
                  within Brazil’s federal units. It is argued that whether
                  states’ agriculture is in plantation style, based on cheap
                  coerced labor, or organized around family farming matters for
                  the formulation of educational policies. According to the main
                  claim, landlords were not interested in paying higher taxes to
                  educate the masses and curtailed the expansion of schooling in
                  order to keep a cheap workforce and maintain their monopoly
                  over the decision-making process. Describing several episodes
                  in Brazil’s history of public instruction, the paper stresses
                  the distributional conflicts over education as well as the
                  rural aristocracy’s resistance towards broadly-targeted,
                  citizenship-enhancing educational policies. The descriptive
                  evidence is complemented by statistical analyses employing
                  historical as well as more recent data. It is shown that
                  states characterized by a more egalitarian land distribution,
                  which are not under the dominance of powerful landlords,

               municipal income per capita and labor productivity. From 1920
               onwards analyses are refined, firstly, by disaggregating the

                  question by analyzing the average and heterogeneous effects of
                  colonial-era Christian missionary activity on human capital
                  accumulation, fertility, and wealth in Nigeria. Our
                  identification strategy exploits discontinuities in mission
                  stations around the borders of some Emirates of Northern
                  Nigeria where missions were restricted from operating by the
                  colonial administration. We find that areas with greater
                  historical missionary activity have higher levels of
                  schooling, lower fertility, and higher household wealth today.
                  The long-run effect of missions is not found in areas with
                  early access to government schools, and is larger for
                  population subgroups—women and Muslims—that have historically
                  suffered disadvantages in access to education. Importantly, we
                  show that the restriction of missions in some Emirates of
                  Northern Nigeria has led to a reversal of fortunes, wherein
                  areas that were more institutionally developed in the

                  are used for crop and livestock, the full soil production

                  novel approach to assess the productive potential of soils,
                  called "SoilPP" and based on soil analysis (0-100 cm) - which

                  presented. Historical yields of sugarcane and soybeans were
                  analyzed, allowing to identify where it is still possible to
                  improve crop yields. The soybean yields were below the
                  estimated SoilPP in 46\% of Brazilian counties and could be
                  improved by proper management practices. For sugarcane, 38\%

                  the significance of differences in national heritage or

                  degree of inequality in wealth, human capital, and political
                  power in accounting for how fundamental economic institutions
                  evolved over time. We argue, moreover, that the roots of these
                  disparities in the extent of inequality lay in differences in
                  the initial factor endowments (dating back to the era of
                  European colonization). We document -- through comparative
                  studies of suffrage, public land, and schooling policies --
                  systematic patterns by which societies in the Americas that
                  began with more extreme inequality or heterogeneity in the
                  population were more likely to develop institutional
                  structures that greatly advantaged members of elite classes
                  (and disadvantaging the bulk of the population) by providing
                  them with more political influence and access to economic
                  opportunities. The clear implication is that institutions
                  should not be presumed to be exogenous; economists need to
                  learn more about where they come from to understand their
                  relation to economic development. Our findings not only
                  contribute to our knowledge of why extreme differences in the

  abstract     = {Omitted variables are a common concern in empirical research.
                  We distinguish between two ways omitted variables can affect
                  baseline estimates: by driving them to zero or by reversing
                  their sign. We show that, depending on how the impact of
                  omitted variables is measured, it can be substantially easier
                  for omitted variables to flip coefficient signs than to drive
                  them to zero. Consequently, results which are considered
                  robust to being "explained away" by omitted variables are not
                  necessarily robust to sign changes. We show that this behavior
                  occurs with "Oster's delta" (Oster 2019), a commonly reported
                  measure of regression coefficient robustness to the presence
                  of omitted variables. Specifically, we show that any time this
                  measure is large--suggesting that omitted variables may be
                  unimportant--a much smaller value reverses the sign of the
                  parameter of interest. Relatedly, we show that selection bias
                  adjusted estimands can be extremely sensitive to the choice of
                  the sensitivity parameter. Specifically, researchers commonly
                  compute a bias adjustment under the assumption that Oster's
                  delta equals one. Under the alternative assumption that delta
                  is very close to one, but not exactly equal to one, we show
                  that the bias can instead be arbitrarily large. To address
                  these concerns, we propose a modified measure of robustness
                  that accounts for such sign changes, and discuss best
                  practices for assessing sensitivity to omitted variables. We
                  demonstrate this sign flipping behavior in an empirical
                  application to social capital and the rise of the Nazi party,
                  where we show how it can overturn conclusions about
                  robustness, and how our proposed modifications can be used to
                  regain robustness. We analyze three additional empirical
                  applications as well. We implement our proposed methods in the
                  companion Stata module regsensitivity for easy use in
                  practice.}

  abstract  = {The Portuguese economy, since the end of the Iberian Union,
               entered a crisis. To try to solve the economic problems, numerous
               expeditions were promoted to the interior of Brazil in search of
               natural and mineral wealth. Within this exploratory logic, the
               occupation of Minas Gerais was established as of the end of the
               17th century. From that moment on, people from all regions of the
               empire gradually occupied the Generals in search of gold, other
               economic activities and rapid enrichment. To control this
               exploration and territorial expansion, the Crown adopts the
               Portuguese Crown land concessions, which consisted of the
               donation of a land improvement to those willing to colonize the
               territory and make it productive in some way. From this
               perspective, this thesis aims to investigate the formation of the
               Minas Gerais space from this kind of land concession. For this, a
               thorough analysis of the Inventário das Cartas de Sesmarias was
               made available in the Arquivo Público Mineiro, this inventory,
               which contains the description of all the Portguese Crwon land
               concession that were distributed in Minas Gerais. With the
               creation of a database made from the transcription of this
               inventory, it was possible to establish dialogues with the
               History of Minas, comprising each economic moment throughout the
               18th and early 19th centuries, relating them to the spatial
               occupation of the Captaincy. Through the techniques of
               georeferencing and Space History, it was possible to establish
               important aspects of the relationship between History and
               Geography, as well as the understanding of formation and spatial
               transformation. Finally, the Sesmariasl system was analyzed,
               evaluating its distribution over periods, by type of donations,
               the titles of sesmeiros, in order to understand how this system
               relates to the economic and social formation of Minas Gerais and
               trying to understand what shape the space is formed from the
               socioeconomic needs of each region. From these analyzes, it was
               concluded that the space of Minas Gerais followed the movements
               of economic activities in each region over time, realizing the
               expansion of the frontiers of mining occupation and the
               retraction of the frontiers of the hinterland, from the
               understanding that these they are not static and are constantly
               changing.},

                  conversion in the Amazon and most recently to monitor the
                  Cerrado biome. However, there is still a gap of annual land
                  use and land cover (LULC) information in all Brazilian biomes
                  in the country. Existing countrywide efforts to map land use
                  and land cover lack regularly updates and high spatial
                  resolution time-series data to better understand historical
                  land use and land cover dynamics, and the subsequent impacts
                  in the country biomes. In this study, we described a novel
                  approach and the results achieved by a multi-disciplinary
                  network called MapBiomas to reconstruct annual land use and
                  land cover information between 1985 and 2017 for Brazil, based
                  on random forest applied to Landsat archive using Google Earth
                  Engine. We mapped five major classes: forest, non-forest
                  natural formation, farming, non-vegetated areas, and water.
                  These classes were broken into two sub-classification levels
                  leading to the most comprehensive and detailed mapping for the
                  country at a 30 m pixel resolution. The average overall
                  accuracy of the land use and land cover time-series, based on
                  a stratified random sample of 75,000 pixel locations, was 89\%
                  ranging from 73 to 95\% in the biomes. The 33 years of LULC
                  change data series revealed that Brazil lost 71 Mha of natural
                  vegetation, mostly to cattle ranching and agriculture
                  activities. Pasture expanded by 46\% from 1985 to 2017, and
                  agriculture by 172\%, mostly replacing old pasture fields. We
                  also identified that 86 Mha of the converted native vegetation
                  was undergoing some level of regrowth. Several applications of
                  the MapBiomas dataset are underway, suggesting that
                  reconstructing historical land use and land cover change maps

                  the Homestead Act were both passed in 1862. Each gave away
                  massive federal lands, created incentives to rush construction
                  and settlement, and (at least partly) dissipated land values.
                  I argue that these apparently wealth-reducing actions
                  rationally utilized railroads and settlers to establish
                  meaningful federal ownership over the frontier and allowed for
                  future federal land sales to take place. This paper examines
                  the tenuous US sovereignty in the West, the institutional
                  details of the land grants, and (using newly digitized
                  records) the relationship among railroads, homesteads, and
                  cash sales to test the theory that “giving away an empire” was
                  a rational strategy to establish economic property rights

                  to the agrarian question and the dominance of the large
                  latifundio estates as the key to explaining their countries’
                  underdevelopment. Yet, in more recent years, the emphasis on
                  agrarian structures has declined and the latifundio is no
                  longer seen as a relevant factor to economic development. In
                  its place have emerged explanations that emphasize
                  international trade relations, institutions, or the capacity
                  of local states. This study makes a case for bringing the
                  latifundio “back in” to explanations of underdevelopment in
                  Latin America, and points to the persistence of particular
                  property relations, low-intensity land use, and low-risk
                  productive strategies throughout the region as barriers to
                  development. Agricultural census data and various other
                  sources on land use suggest that large latifundio estates are
                  still a relevant factor throughout the region, and I argue
                  that they continue to represent a significant barrier for the
                  deepening of industrialization. Resumen Intelectuales
                  latinoamericanos en el siglo veinte frecuentemente senalaban a
                  la cuestion agraria y la dominacion latifundiaria como la
                  clave para explicar el subdesarrollo de sus paises. Sin
                  embargo, en anos recientes el enfasis en estructuras agrarias
                  ha disminuido, y el latifundio ya no es visto como un factor
                  relevante para el desarrollo economico. En su lugar, han
                  surgido explicaciones que enfatizan el comercio internacional,
                  las instituciones nacionales y la capacidad del estado de
                  promover el desarrollo. El presente estudio argumenta que

              receiver of African slaves and the last country to abolish this
              institution in the Western Hemisphere, in 1888. To deal with the
              endogeneity of slavery placement, we use a spatial Regression
              Discontinuity Design (RDD), exploiting the Tordesillas Treaty,
              which established the colonial boundaries between the Portuguese
              and Spanish empires within Brazil. We find that the number of
              slaves in 1872 is discontinuously higher on the Portuguese side of
              the border, consistent with this power's comparative advantage in
              transatlantic slavery. We then show how this differential slave
              rate led to higher modern income inequality of 0.04 points (of the
              Gini Index), close to 10\% of the average income inequality in the
              country. In terms of mechanisms, we find a wider income gap, and
              important differences in education, employment and prejudice for
              blacks in modern times. We rule out the role of colonizer identity

  abstract  = {Downloadable! Brazil is frequently portrayed as exhibiting
               persistent and structural economic inequality that is rooted in
               the early colonial experience, and is believed to undermine
               development in the long run. I construct original measures of
               agricultural inequality for 1905 in what is today Brazil’s
               largest state, using farm-level micro data for some 50,000 farms.
               Using these measures of inequality, along with contemporary
               covariates and other historical variables I assess the impact of
               colonial institutions, slavery, farm inequality, and political
               inequality on long-term development in São Paulo. The principal
               findings are: (1) a potentially coercive colonial institution,
               the aldeamento, is positively correlated with income per capita
               at the end of the twentieth century; (2) measures of the
               intensity of slavery have little if any independent impact on
               income in 2000; (3) farm inequality was not persistent in São
               Paulo at the county level over the twentieth century; (4) in both
               OLS and IV estimates, no negative effect can be found for 1905
               inequality on long-term development; (5) political inequality in
               the early twentieth century, measured by the extent of the
               franchise, is unrelated to contemporary farm inequality, and also
               unrelated to long-term economic growth; and (6) the provision of
               local public goods in the early twentieth century, measured by
               local public education outlays, has a positive impact on
               long-term development, but was not related to contemporary
               economic or political inequality. Overall, neither the intensity
               of slavery nor the pattern of inequality had any discernable
               negative economic impact in the long run.},

                  development within Brazil. I first exploit variation in
                  temperature and precipitation to instrument for the local
                  distribution of land in 1920 using a two stage least squares
                  instrumental variables framework. My instrument is an index
                  quantifying the suitability of local climatic conditions for
                  plantation versus smallholder agriculture. I construct this
                  index using information on the growing conditions of crops
                  within certain plant taxonomies that are more biologically
                  suited for smallholder or plantation production. I argue that
                  this index more fully identifies the optimal environmental
                  conditions for these two types of agricultural production, and
                  I show that it serves as a robust predictor of local land
                  inequality in the year 1920. IV estimates then reveal that
                  greater inequality is associated with less local government
                  spending on welfare and public goods over the 1995-2005 time
                  period, as well as reductions in measures of local government
                  quality and per-child education spending. It is also
                  associated with lower levels of development, as measured by
                  the local Human Development Index (HDI) for the year 2000.
                  Inequality primarily affects the HDI through shorter life
                  expectancies and lower incomes. I argue that the latter is
                  consistent with the agrarian elite obstructing the transition
                  of the local economy from agriculture to industry/services, as
                  historically unequal municipalities contain a greater
                  percentage of workers in the lower-wage agriculture sector,
                  and this sector itself constitutes a larger share of local
                  GDP.}

                 the distribution of power of local political elites. We
                 document that municipalities that were more politically
                 concentrated prior to the dictatorship in the 1960s are
                 relatively richer in 2000, despite being poorer initially. Our
                 evidence suggests that this reversal of fortune was the result
                 of the military’s policies aimed at undermining the power of
                 traditional elites. These policies increased political
                 competition locally, which ultimately led to better governance,

  abstract  = {The Amazon, the world's largest rain forest, is the last frontier
               in Brazil. The settlement of large and small farmers, squatters,
               miners, and loggers in this frontier during the past thirty years
               has given rise to violent conflicts over land as well as
               environmental duress. Titles, Conflict, and Land Use examines the
               institutional development involved in the process of land use and
               ownership in the Amazon and shows how this phenomenon affects the
               behavior of the economic actors. It explores the way in which the
               absence of well-defined property rights in the Amazon has led to
               both economic and social problems, including lost investment
               opportunities, high costs in protecting claims, and violence. The
               relationship between land reform and violence is given special
               attention. The book offers an important application of the New
               Institutional Economics by examining a rare instance where
               institutional change can be empirically observed. This allows the
               authors to study property rights as they emerge and evolve and to
               analyze the effects of Amazon development on the economy. In
               doing so they illustrate well the point that often the evolution
               of economic institutions will not lead to efficient outcomes.
               This book will be important not only to economists but also to
               Latin Americanists, political scientists, anthropologists, and
               scholars in disciplines concerned with the environment. Lee

                  early settlement by the Dutch of the Cape Colony at the
                  southern tip of Africa. After its founding in 1652 as a
                  provisioning outpost for ships of the Dutch East India Company
                  (VOC), the colonial government promoted settlement initially
                  by granting land with well‐specified and enforced property
                  rights in restricted zones near Cape Town. By 1714 it
                  transitioned to accommodate rapidly expanding settlement by
                  creating a weaker form of property rights, the loan farm,
                  which was imprecisely defined and had limited government
                  enforcement. We develop a profit‐maximizing monopsony model to
                  explain the VOC's choice to transition from the
                  better‐specified land grant to the less well‐specified loan
                  farm. We conclude that the decline in the population size and
                  ability of the Khoikhoi, the Cape's original inhabitants, to
                  organize effective resistance to the Dutch invasion was
                  critical to the transition, as it lowered the costs of private
                  enforcement of settlers’ territorial claims. The choice of
                  property rights thus enabled and encouraged the rapid taking
                  by European settlers of the western Cape of Africa for the
                  expansion of the Dutch colony's pastoral economy.},

                  rural unrest? And why does land reform that ostensibly
                  addresses rural grievances sometimes exacerbate unrest? We
                  advance the understanding of these longstanding questions by
                  shifting the emphasis from how landholding inequality fuels
                  rural grievances to how it captures the collective action
                  capacity of landowners. Using municipal-level data from
                  Brazil?s large land reform program from 1988 to 2013, we
                  demonstrate that the relationship between landholding
                  inequality and unrest is conditional. Isolated threats to
                  landed elites in the form of land invasions are difficult to
                  repel, generating a positive relationship between landholding
                  inequality and one-off land invasions. By contrast, sustained,
                  broader local threats triggered by nearby land reforms
                  catalyze landowner organization to repel land invasions,
                  leading to the reverse relationship. The findings provide a
                  novel answer for why a straightforward link between land
                  inequality and rural unrest is elusive and may generalize to a
                  broad range of similar cases.},

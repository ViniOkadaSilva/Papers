               peculiar development of plantation society over a three hundred
               year period in Bahia, a major sugar plantation zone and an
               important terminus of the Atlantic slave trade. Drawing on
               little-used archival sources, plantations accounts, and notarial
               records, Professor Schwartz has examined through both
               quantitative and qualitative methods the various groups that
               made up plantation society. While he devotes much attention to
               masters and slaves, he views slavery ultimately as part of a
               larger structure of social and economic relations. The
               peculiarities of sugar-making and the nature of plantation
               labour are used throughout the book as keys to an understanding
               of roles and relationships in plantation society. A comparative
               perspective is also employed, so that studies of slavery
               elsewhere in the Americas inform the analysis, while at many
               points direct comparisons of the Bahian case with other
               plantation societies are also made.",

  abstract  = "Land tenure in many parts of Brazil remains uncertain and
               controversial. These problems have recently been exacerbated by
               changes in the legal framework regulating protected areas and
               the land market. A particular challenge facing attempts to
               improve land tenure security and governance in Brazil is the
               lack of a single, integrated assessment of all types of lands.
               Here we address this problem and present a first, integrated map
               of Brazilian land tenure encompassing all official data sources
               pertaining to both public and private lands. Of the total (8.5
               million km2) 36.1\% of all lands are public (with 6.4\%
               officially undesignated), 44.2\% are private, and 16.6\% are
               unregistered or with unknown tenure. Strikingly, overlaps among
               land tenure categories sum to 50\% of the registered territory
               of Brazil. A clearer understanding of uncertainties in land
               tenure, and the spatial distribution of those uncertainties can
               help guide research and public policies focused on minimizing
               land conflicts and strengthening governance and territorial

  abstract  = "Portuguese colonists carried their conceptions of social
               organization to the Americas. Their ideal was to ``live like a
               gentleman,'' that is, to own land and command laborers in order
               to distance themselves from manual labor and exercise
               patriarchal authority over a large household. Their property
               also allowed them the time and resources to be active in local
               politics and serve the Crown. They intended to reproduce in the
               New World the lifestyle of the Portuguese provincial nobility.
               There were, however, huge differences, since in Brazil the elite
               lorded over enslaved persons instead of peasants. The first
               elite families made their fortunes through the conquest and
               enslavement of Native Americans in the second half of the 16th
               century, but many of them did not manage to maintain their
               position during the transition to enslaved African labor in the
               following decades. Especially in the most dynamic areas, such as
               Pernambuco and Bahia, the first half of the 17th century was a
               period of flux in elite composition. By mid-century, however, a
               small number of families controlled most local offices, slowly
               fashioning themselves into local nobilities and wielding these
               claims to negotiate with the Crown and its representatives.
               Planter elites also established broad patron-client networks
               that included even their enslaved property. Nevertheless, their
               preeminence was threatened by the rise of merchant power in the
               18th century, boosted by the huge demographic and economic
               expansion derived from gold discoveries in the southeast and the
               development of the internal market. Nevertheless, the noble
               ideal did not lose its appeal, and many rich merchants linked
               themselves to old noble families through marriage and the
               adoption of an aristocratic lifestyle.",

  abstract = "How does labor scarcity shape institutional development? We
              examine the long-term impact of Mexico's 16th-century demographic
              collapse on landholding patterns through the present day. We show
              that the collapse, which reduced the indigenous population by
              between 70 and 90 percent and differed in severity across space,
              facilitated land concentration and the rise of a landowner class
              that dominated Mexican political economy for centuries. To
              identify the impact of the population collapse on land
              arrangements we use an instrumental-variables identification
              strategy exploiting climatic shocks associated with an epidemic
              in the 1570s that roughly halved the indigenous population.
              Though landholding patterns were transformed following the
              Revolution of 1910, we also show that disease-impacted areas now
              have more land in common-property institutions with limited
              property rights. The population collapse thus had a persistent
              impact on Mexican political economy, but the nature of this
              impact has changed radically over time.",

               Latin America, tenancy rates are low compared to the U.S. and
               the OECD countries. We test for the importance of insecure
               property rights in Brazil on the reluctance of landowners to
               rent because of a fear of expropriation arising from land
               reform. Since 1964, the Land Statute in Brazil has targeted
               rental lands for redistribution. The expropriation of farms,
               resulting from land conflicts, is currently at the heart of land
               reform policies in Brazil. Land conflicts are a means for
               landless peasants to bring attention to land reform agencies for
               the need for redistribution. Land conflicts may also signal to
               landowners that their land is at risk for expropriation.
               Utilizing data across all counties in Brazil, we found that land
               conflicts reduce the likelihood of tenancy. This result implies:
               a reduction in agricultural efficiency; a reduction in the
               well-being of potential tenants, now landless peasants; and an
               expansion of the agricultural frontier through deforestation.

                 mobility during the Ming-Qing (1368-1911) period. Using status
                 information based on the timing of marriage from family
                 histories in Central China, already in the early 1500s it is
                 the case that daughters from rich families attain higher
                 status over their lifetime than daughters from poorer
                 families. This intergenerational status persistence is partly
                 due to marital sorting because daughters from high-status
                 families tend to become the wives of sons who themselves come
                 from rich families. Quantitatively, the correlation of 0.6
                 between the status of biological and in-law families means
                 that marriage accounts for more than one third of total
                 intergenerational status transmission, while not accounting
                 for marriage overestimates mobility by more than 20 percent.
                 Further underscoring the importance of marriage, typically the
                 status of the in-law family plays a larger role for
                 intergenerational status transmission than the child's
                 biological grandparents. Over the period 1500 to 1900, the
                 degree of marital sorting falls, as does intergenerational
                 persistence. Lower investments in the marriage market to find
                 a good match for a daughter go hand in hand with the fall in

  author    = "Mueller, Bernardo Pinheiro M",
  editor    = "Alston, Lee J",
  abstract  = "Land in Brazil is the common theme that binds together the three
               essays that compose this dissertation. The first essay examines
               the economic history of land policy in Brazil, from early
               colonial policy to the tardy formation of a market for land by
               the end of the nineteenth century. This is done by comparing the
               development of the Brazilian land policy with the path that was
               followed in the United States, where a market for land evolved
               much more quickly and led to a considerably less concentrated
               ownership structure. The second essay analyzes the political
               economy of agrarian reform in Brazil. The focus is on three
               periods when serious attempts were made to carry out an agrarian
               reform; the military regime, the New Republic and the writing of
               the Constitution in 1988. In each of these attempts there was a
               perception that an agrarian reform would yield important social
               and economic benefits. However, despite the genuine intentions
               of policy makers the reforms were either blocked or reversed and
               had little effect on the concentration of land ownership. These
               events provide an interesting case study of the political
               economy of economic reform and institutional change.
               Additionally this essay uses the data from the votes of the
               National Constituent Assembly of 1988 to test both a capture
               model and a capture plus ideology model for the interests
               concerned with agrarian reform. Finally, the third essay
               examines the behavior of settlers on the Amazon frontier as
               concerns the use of land. This is modeled dynamically focusing
               on the security of property rights and its effects on the
               settlers' decisions. The optimal paths which result from the
               model are illustrated through a simulation.",

               resolve disputes? In this essay, I shall demonstrate the power
               of an unsettling norm: The Brazilian legal system aims neither
               to solve land conflicts justly nor to decide their legal merits
               through adjudication. My argument stresses intention and norm
               because land law in Brazil is so confusing, indecisive, and
               dysfunctional in its own terms that one suspects that the cause
               of these characteristics is not incompetence or corruption alone
               but rather the force of a set of intentions concerning its
               construction and application different from those aimed at
               resolution. Thus, I argue that Brazilian law regularly produces
               unresolvable procedural and substantive complexity in land
               conflicts; that this jural-bureaucratic irresolution dependably
               initiates extrajudicial solutions; and that these political
               impositions inevitably legalize usurpations of one sort or
               another. In short, land law in Brazil promotes conflict, not
               resolution, because it sets the terms through which
               encroachments are reliably legalized. It is thus an instrument
               of calculated disorder by means of which illegal practices
               produce law and extralegal solutions are smuggled into the
               judicial process. In this paradoxical context, law itself is a
               means of manipulation, complication, stratagem, and violence by
               which all parties---public and private, dominant and
               subaltern---further their interests. It therefore defines an
               arena of conflict in which distinctions between legal and
               illegal are temporary and their relations unstable.",

  abstract  = "Most analysts of the modern Latin American economy have held the
               pessimistic belief in historical persistence?they believe that
               Latin America has always had very high levels of inequality, and
               that it is the Iberian colonists' fault. Thus, modern analysts
               see today a more unequal Latin America compared with Asia and
               most rich post-industrial nations and assume that this must
               always have been true. Indeed, some have argued that high
               inequality appeared very early in the post-conquest Americas,
               and that this fact supported rent-seeking and anti-growth
               institutions which help explain the disappointing growth
               performance we observe there even today. The recent leveling of
               inequality in the region since the 1990s seems to have done
               little to erode that pessimism. It is important, therefore, to
               stress that this alleged persistence is based on an historical
               literature which has made little or no effort to be comparative,
               and it matters. Compared with the rest of the world, inequality
               was not high in the century following 1492, and it was not even
               high in the post-independence decades just prior to Latin
               America's belle {\'e}poque and start with industrialization. It
               only became high during the commodity boom 1870?1913, by the end
               of which it had joined the rich country unequal club that
               included the USA and the UK. Latin America only became
               relatively high between 1913 and the 1970s when it missed the
               Great Egalitarian Leveling, which took place almost everywhere
               else. That Latin American inequality has its roots in its

               of drawing together; a contract brings together not only the
               interested parties, but is itself a bundled and, ideally,
               coherent set of norms with legally binding status. In this
               chapter, we unbundle some facets of a labor-rental arrangement
               that has caught the attention of generations of social
               scientists, namely sharecropping contracts. We study the
               enforcement of this contract in the southwestern Brazilian
               plantations of S{\~a}o Paulo since the 1840s as the first
               experiment to substitute enslaved labor in ordinary agricultural
               tasks, mostly with immigrants. The adoption of crop-sharing
               clauses and their changes over time relate to the histories of
               the transition from slavery and immigration to Brazil -- themes
               of a classical historiography that we revisit in this chapter.
               We start by analyzing four constituent dimensions of
               sharecropping as employed in Brazil, showing that this contract
               was simultaneously a labor arrangement, a mechanism of
               cost-sharing, a land-rental contract, and a form to bond labor
               with a credit interlinkage. In the second part of the chapter,
               we discuss how some of these features influenced labor-rental
               arrangements at the beginning of the twentieth century. We show
               the pervasiveness of sharecropping as a contract per se, as well
               as the influences that those four dimensions had on new
               labor-rental arrangements.",

                 various contracts to bond immigrant households with a
                 credit-labor interlinkage. The aim is to discuss why different
                 laborrental arrangements were adopted. In particular,
                 vis-{\`a}-vis the alternatives of fixed rents and wage

                 was more important to landowners than specific labor-rental
                 regimes. The credit supplied by landowners allowed for the
                 tying of immigrants via indebtedness. This mechanism
                 guaranteed a secure and stable supply of labor to local
                 agricultural elites and permitted the immigration of poor and
                 credit-constrained Europeans. This prepared the insertion of
                 Brazil into the global circuit of the Age of Mass Migration
                 without promoting institutional reforms to attract non-bonded
                 immigrants. Second, sharecropping became the most prevalent
                 contract in the first phase of the transition from slavery not
                 because of an economically rational decision taken by
                 landowners, but more as an emulation of other historical and
                 international experiences with this labor-rental arrangement.",

                 socio-economic condition in agriculture yet in Brazil and
                 Latin America, tenancy rates are low compared to the U.S. and
                 the OECD countries. We test for the importance of insecure
                 property rights in Brazil on the reluctance of landowners to
                 rent because of a fear of expropriation arising from land
                 reform. Since 1964, the Land Statute in Brazil has targeted
                 rental lands for redistribution. The expropriation of farms,
                 resulting from land conflicts, is currently at the heart of
                 land reform policies in Brazil. Land conflicts are a means for
                 landless peasants to bring attention to land reform agencies
                 for the need for redistribution. Land conflicts may also
                 signal to landowners that their land is at risk for
                 expropriation. Utilizing data across all counties in Brazil,
                 we found that land conflicts reduce the likelihood of tenancy.
                 This result implies: a reduction in agricultural efficiency; a
                 reduction in the well-being of potential tenants, now landless
                 peasants; and an expansion of the agricultural frontier
                 through deforestation. Because of endogeneity between land
                 tenancy and land conflict we instrument land conflict with

  abstract  = "[What is the relationship between landholding inequality and
               rural unrest? And why does land reform that ostensibly addresses
               rural grievances sometimes exacerbate unrest? We advance the
               understanding of these longstanding questions by shifting the
               emphasis from how landholding inequality fuels rural grievances
               to how it captures the collective action capacity of landowners.
               Using municipal-level data from Brazil's large land reform
               program from 1988 to 2013, we demonstrate that the relationship
               between landholding inequality and unrest is conditional.
               Isolated threats to landed elites in the form of land invasions
               are difficult to repel, generating a positive relationship
               between landholding inequality and one-off land invasions. By
               contrast, sustained, broader local threats triggered by nearby
               land reforms catalyze landowner organization to repel land
               invasions, leading to the reverse relationship. The findings
               provide a novel answer for why a straightforward link between

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTThe present paper explores the relationship between
               agrarian structure and human capital formation between and
               within Brazil's federal units. It is argued that whether states'
               agriculture is in plantation style, based on cheap coerced
               labor, or organized around family farming matters for the
               formulation of educational policies. According to the main
               claim, landlords were not interested in paying higher taxes to
               educate the masses and curtailed the expansion of schooling in
               order to keep a cheap workforce and maintain their monopoly over
               the decision-making process. Describing several episodes in
               Brazil's history of public instruction, the paper stresses the
               distributional conflicts over education as well as the rural
               aristocracy's resistance towards broadly-targeted,
               citizenship-enhancing educational policies. The descriptive
               evidence is complemented by statistical analyses employing
               historical as well as more recent data. It is shown that states
               characterized by a more egalitarian land distribution, which are
               not under the dominance of powerful landlords, exhibit better
               educational coverage and enhanced instruction quality. They also

              stations around the borders of some Emirates of Northern Nigeria
              where missions were restricted from operating by the colonial
              administration. We find that areas with greater historical
              missionary activity have higher levels of schooling, lower
              fertility, and higher household wealth today. The long-run effect
              of missions is not found in areas with early access to government
              schools, and is larger for population subgroups---women and
              Muslims---that have historically suffered disadvantages in access
              to education. Importantly, we show that the restriction of
              missions in some Emirates of Northern Nigeria has led to a
              reversal of fortunes, wherein areas that were more
              institutionally developed in the precolonial period are
              relatively poorer today as a result of a slower pace of the
              demographic transition. The findings support the predictions of
              the unified theory of economic growth, whereby technological
              advancement leads to greater demand for education, triggering a
              fertility decline and resulting in higher incomes.",

              the general population, while in others over three times as

              significantly lower among migrant women, who were more likely to

              relationship between migrant flows and self-selection, notably

               entered a crisis. To try to solve the economic problems,
               numerous expeditions were promoted to the interior of Brazil in
               search of natural and mineral wealth. Within this exploratory
               logic, the occupation of Minas Gerais was established as of the
               end of the 17th century. From that moment on, people from all
               regions of the empire gradually occupied the Generals in search
               of gold, other economic activities and rapid enrichment. To
               control this exploration and territorial expansion, the Crown
               adopts the Portuguese Crown land concessions, which consisted of
               the donation of a land improvement to those willing to colonize
               the territory and make it productive in some way. From this
               perspective, this thesis aims to investigate the formation of
               the Minas Gerais space from this kind of land concession. For
               this, a thorough analysis of the Invent{\'a}rio das Cartas de
               Sesmarias was made available in the Arquivo P{\'u}blico Mineiro,
               this inventory, which contains the description of all the
               Portguese Crwon land concession that were distributed in Minas
               Gerais. With the creation of a database made from the
               transcription of this inventory, it was possible to establish
               dialogues with the History of Minas, comprising each economic
               moment throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries, relating
               them to the spatial occupation of the Captaincy. Through the
               techniques of georeferencing and Space History, it was possible
               to establish important aspects of the relationship between
               History and Geography, as well as the understanding of formation
               and spatial transformation. Finally, the Sesmariasl system was
               analyzed, evaluating its distribution over periods, by type of
               donations, the titles of sesmeiros, in order to understand how
               this system relates to the economic and social formation of
               Minas Gerais and trying to understand what shape the space is
               formed from the socioeconomic needs of each region. From these
               analyzes, it was concluded that the space of Minas Gerais
               followed the movements of economic activities in each region
               over time, realizing the expansion of the frontiers of mining
               occupation and the retraction of the frontiers of the
               hinterland, from the understanding that these they are not

  abstract  = "Brazil has a monitoring system to track annual forest conversion
               in the Amazon and most recently to monitor the Cerrado biome.
               However, there is still a gap of annual land use and land cover
               (LULC) information in all Brazilian biomes in the country.
               Existing countrywide efforts to map land use and land cover lack
               regularly updates and high spatial resolution time-series data
               to better understand historical land use and land cover
               dynamics, and the subsequent impacts in the country biomes. In
               this study, we described a novel approach and the results
               achieved by a multi-disciplinary network called MapBiomas to
               reconstruct annual land use and land cover information between
               1985 and 2017 for Brazil, based on random forest applied to
               Landsat archive using Google Earth Engine. We mapped five major
               classes: forest, non-forest natural formation, farming,
               non-vegetated areas, and water. These classes were broken into
               two sub-classification levels leading to the most comprehensive
               and detailed mapping for the country at a 30 m pixel resolution.
               The average overall accuracy of the land use and land cover
               time-series, based on a stratified random sample of 75,000 pixel
               locations, was 89\% ranging from 73 to 95\% in the biomes. The
               33 years of LULC change data series revealed that Brazil lost 71
               Mha of natural vegetation, mostly to cattle ranching and
               agriculture activities. Pasture expanded by 46\% from 1985 to
               2017, and agriculture by 172\%, mostly replacing old pasture
               fields. We also identified that 86 Mha of the converted native
               vegetation was undergoing some level of regrowth. Several
               applications of the MapBiomas dataset are underway, suggesting
               that reconstructing historical land use and land cover change
               maps is useful for advancing the science and to guide social,
               economic and environmental policy decision-making processes in

                  inequality at the receiving end. We focus on Brazil, the
                  largest receiver of African slaves and the last country to
                  abolish this institution in the Western Hemisphere, in 1888.
                  To deal with the endogeneity of slavery placement, we use a
                  spatial Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), exploiting the
                  Tordesillas Treaty, which established the colonial boundaries
                  between the Portuguese and Spanish empires within Brazil. We
                  find that the number of slaves in 1872 is discontinuously
                  higher on the Portuguese side of the border, consistent with
                  this power's comparative advantage in transatlantic slavery.
                  We then show how this differential slave rate led to higher
                  modern income inequality of 0.04 points (of the Gini Index),
                  close to 10\% of the average income inequality in the
                  country. In terms of mechanisms, we find a wider income gap,

                  prejudice for blacks in modern times. We rule out the role of

  abstract  = "Downloadable! Brazil is frequently portrayed as exhibiting
               persistent and structural economic inequality that is rooted in
               the early colonial experience, and is believed to undermine
               development in the long run. I construct original measures of
               agricultural inequality for 1905 in what is today Brazil's
               largest state, using farm-level micro data for some 50,000
               farms. Using these measures of inequality, along with
               contemporary covariates and other historical variables I assess
               the impact of colonial institutions, slavery, farm inequality,
               and political inequality on long-term development in S{\~a}o
               Paulo. The principal findings are: (1) a potentially coercive
               colonial institution, the aldeamento, is positively correlated
               with income per capita at the end of the twentieth century; (2)
               measures of the intensity of slavery have little if any
               independent impact on income in 2000; (3) farm inequality was
               not persistent in S{\~a}o Paulo at the county level over the
               twentieth century; (4) in both OLS and IV estimates, no negative
               effect can be found for 1905 inequality on long-term
               development; (5) political inequality in the early twentieth
               century, measured by the extent of the franchise, is unrelated
               to contemporary farm inequality, and also unrelated to long-term
               economic growth; and (6) the provision of local public goods in
               the early twentieth century, measured by local public education
               outlays, has a positive impact on long-term development, but was
               not related to contemporary economic or political inequality.
               Overall, neither the intensity of slavery nor the pattern of
               inequality had any discernable negative economic impact in the
               long run.",

               development within Brazil. I first exploit variation in
               temperature and precipitation to instrument for the local
               distribution of land in 1920 using a two stage least squares
               instrumental variables framework. My instrument is an index
               quantifying the suitability of local climatic conditions for
               plantation versus smallholder agriculture. I construct this
               index using information on the growing conditions of crops
               within certain plant taxonomies that are more biologically
               suited for smallholder or plantation production. I argue that
               this index more fully identifies the optimal environmental
               conditions for these two types of agricultural production, and I
               show that it serves as a robust predictor of local land
               inequality in the year 1920. IV estimates then reveal that
               greater inequality is associated with less local government
               spending on welfare and public goods over the 1995-2005 time
               period, as well as reductions in measures of local government
               quality and per-child education spending. It is also associated
               with lower levels of development, as measured by the local Human
               Development Index (HDI) for the year 2000. Inequality primarily
               affects the HDI through shorter life expectancies and lower
               incomes. I argue that the latter is consistent with the agrarian
               elite obstructing the transition of the local economy from
               agriculture to industry/services, as historically unequal
               municipalities contain a greater percentage of workers in the
               lower-wage agriculture sector, and this sector itself
               constitutes a larger share of local GDP.",

                 the distribution of power of local political elites. We
                 document that municipalities that were more politically
                 concentrated prior to the dictatorship in the 1960s are
                 relatively richer in 2000, despite being poorer initially. Our
                 evidence suggests that this reversal of fortune was the result
                 of the military's policies aimed at undermining the power of
                 traditional elites. These policies increased political

  abstract  = "The Amazon, the world's largest rain forest, is the last
               frontier in Brazil. The settlement of large and small farmers,
               squatters, miners, and loggers in this frontier during the past
               thirty years has given rise to violent conflicts over land as
               well as environmental duress. Titles, Conflict, and Land Use
               examines the institutional development involved in the process
               of land use and ownership in the Amazon and shows how this
               phenomenon affects the behavior of the economic actors. It
               explores the way in which the absence of well-defined property
               rights in the Amazon has led to both economic and social
               problems, including lost investment opportunities, high costs in
               protecting claims, and violence. The relationship between land
               reform and violence is given special attention. The book offers
               an important application of the New Institutional Economics by
               examining a rare instance where institutional change can be
               empirically observed. This allows the authors to study property
               rights as they emerge and evolve and to analyze the effects of
               Amazon development on the economy. In doing so they illustrate
               well the point that often the evolution of economic institutions
               will not lead to efficient outcomes. This book will be important
               not only to economists but also to Latin Americanists, political
               scientists, anthropologists, and scholars in disciplines

               of the Cape Colony, 1652--1750",
  author    = "Dye, Alan and La Croix, Sumner",
  abstract  = "We examine the formation of property rights in land during the
               early settlement by the Dutch of the Cape Colony at the southern
               tip of Africa. After its founding in 1652 as a provisioning
               outpost for ships of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), the
               colonial government promoted settlement initially by granting
               land with well‐specified and enforced property rights in
               restricted zones near Cape Town. By 1714 it transitioned to
               accommodate rapidly expanding settlement by creating a weaker
               form of property rights, the loan farm, which was imprecisely
               defined and had limited government enforcement. We develop a
               profit‐maximizing monopsony model to explain the VOC's choice to
               transition from the better‐specified land grant to the less
               well‐specified loan farm. We conclude that the decline in the
               population size and ability of the Khoikhoi, the Cape's original
               inhabitants, to organize effective resistance to the Dutch
               invasion was critical to the transition, as it lowered the costs
               of private enforcement of settlers' territorial claims. The
               choice of property rights thus enabled and encouraged the rapid
               taking by European settlers of the western Cape of Africa for
               the expansion of the Dutch colony's pastoral economy.",
